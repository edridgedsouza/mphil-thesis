The Sox gene family functions in many aspects in embryogenesis, including testis development, CNS neurogenesis, oligodendrocyte development, chondrogenesis, neural crest cell development and other respects.

Besides, researchers have found that Sox8 and Sox9 have functions in the male fertility maintenance after birth.

Recently, many examples of the involvement of Sox-POU partnerships in transcription have been discovered, including a partnership between Sox-2 and Oct-3. Little is known about the mechanisms by which these factors modulate transcription. To better understand the molecular interactions involved, we mapped the location of the transactivation domain of Sox-2. This was done in the context of its interaction with Oct-3, as well as its ability to transactivate as a fusion protein linked to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4. Both approaches demonstrated that Sox-2 contains a transactivation domain in its C-terminal half, containing a serine-rich region and the C terminus. We also determined that the viral oncoprotein E1a inhibits the ability of the Gal4/Sox-2 fusion protein to transactivate, as well as the transcriptional activation mediated by the combined action of Sox-2 and Oct-3. In contrast, a mutant form of E1a, unable to bind p300, lacks both of these effects. Importantly, we determined that p300 overcomes the inhibitory effects of E1a in both assays. Together, these findings suggest that Sox-2 mediates its effects, at least in part, through the co-activator p300.},

In all higher organisms studied to date, related Group B Sox proteins are co-expressed in the developing CNS; in vertebrates there are three (Sox1, Sox2 and Sox3) and in Drosophila there are two (SoxNeuro and Dichaete). It has been suggested there may be a degree of functional redundancy in Sox function during CNS development. We describe the CNS phenotype of a null mutation in the Drosophila SoxNeuro gene and provide the first direct evidence for both redundant and differential Sox function during CNS development in Drosophila. In the lateral neuroectoderm, where SoxNeuro is uniquely expressed, SoxNeuro mutants show a loss or reduction of achaete expression as well as a loss of many correctly specified lateral neuroblasts. By contrast, in the medial neuroectoderm, where the expression of SoxNeuro and Dichaete overlaps, the phenotypes of both single mutants are mild. In accordance with an at least partially redundant function in that region, SoxNeuro/Dichaete double mutant embryos show a severe neural hypoplasia throughout the central nervous system, as well as a dramatic loss of achaete expressing proneural clusters and medially derived neuroblasts. However, the finding that Dichaete and SoxN exhibit opposite effects on achaete expression within the intermediate neuroectoderm demonstrates that each protein also has region-specific unique functions during early CNS development in the Drosophila embryo.},

While Sox genes have been identified in many invertebrate species, comparatively little is known about their functions outside the well-studied models, Drosophila, sea urchin and nematode. Consequently, we centre this review around the Sox family in Drosophila, comparing this with what is known about orthologous genes in other invertebrate species. We highlight several conserved themes that emerge when looking at the roles Sox proteins appear to play during embryogenesis, including early functions in CNS development and widespread interactions with the Wnt signalling pathway. Comparing the expression of Sox genes in insect species, where genome organisation is conserved but expression is apparently not, highlights the need for more functional data on the roles that related Sox proteins play in organisms outside the well-characterised models.},

	volume = {13},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-213X-13-1},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Group B Sox domain transcription factors play important roles in metazoan central nervous system development. They are, however, difficult to study as mutations often have pleiotropic effects and other Sox family members can mask phenotypes due to functional compensation. In Drosophila melanogaster, the Sox gene Dichaete is dynamically expressed in the embryonic CNS, where it is known to have functional roles in neuroblasts and the ventral midline. In this study, we use inducible dominant negative proteins in combination with ChIP, immunohistochemistry and genome-wide expression profiling to further dissect the role of Dichaete in these two tissues.
RESULTS: We generated two dominant negative Dichaete constructs, one lacking a DNA binding domain and the other fused to the Engrailed transcriptional repressor domain. We expressed these tissue-specifically in the midline and in neuroblasts using the UAS/GAL4 system, validating their use at the phenotypic level and with known target genes. Using ChIP and immunohistochemistry, we identified two new likely direct Dichaete target genes, commisureless in the midline and asense in the neuroectoderm. We performed genome-wide expression profiling in stage 8-9 embryos, identifying almost a thousand potential tissue-specific Dichaete targets, with half of these genes showing evidence of Dichaete binding in vivo. These include a number of genes with known roles in CNS development, including several components of the Notch, Wnt and EGFR signalling pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: As well as identifying commisureless as a target, our data indicate that Dichaete helps establish its expression during early midline development but has less effect on its established later expression, highlighting Dichaete action on tissue specific enhancers. An analysis of the broader range of candidate Dichaete targets indicates that Dichaete plays diverse roles in CNS development, with the 500 or so Dichaete-bound putative targets including a number of transcription factors, signalling pathway components and terminal differentiation genes. In the early neurectoderm we implicate Dichaete in the lateral inhibition pathway and show that Dichaete acts to repress the proneural gene asense. Our analysis also reveals that dominant negatives cause off-target effects, highlighting the need to use other experimental data for validating findings from dominant negative studies.},

Since Dichaete is required for the correct specification or differentiation of midline glia, we have used the ventral midline as a model system to study SOX gene function in vivo and demonstrate a genetic interaction between Dichaete and the POU domain gene ventral veinless. In mammals, a protein related to Dichaete, SOX2, also interacts with POU transcription factors. The midline phenotypes of Dichaete mutations are rescued by expression of mouse SOX2.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sox (Sry-related high-mobility-group box) genes represent important factors in animal development. Relatively little, however, is known about the embryonic expression patterns and thus possible function(s) of Sox genes during ontogenesis in panarthropods (Arthropoda+Tardigrada+Onychophora). To date, studies have been restricted exclusively to higher insects, including the model system Drosophila melanogaster, with no comprehensive data available for any other arthropod group, or any tardigrade or onychophoran.
RESULTS: This study provides a phylogenetic analysis of panarthropod Sox genes and presents the first comprehensive analysis of embryonic expression patterns in the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Hexapoda), the pill millipede Glomeris marginata (Myriapoda), and the velvet worm, Euperipatoides kanangrensis (Onychophora). 24 Sox genes were identified and investigated: 7 in Euperipatoides, 8 in Glomeris, and 9 in Tribolium. Each species possesses at least one ortholog of each of the five expected Sox gene families, B, C, D, E, and F, many of which are differentially expressed during ontogenesis.
CONCLUSION: Sox gene expression (and potentially function) is highly conserved in arthropods and their closest relatives, the onychophorans. Sox B, C and D class genes appear to be crucial for nervous system development, while the Sox B genes Dichaete (D) and Sox21b likely play an additional conserved role in panarthropod segmentation. The Sox B gene Sox21a likely has a conserved function in foregut and Malpighian tubule development, at least in Hexapoda. The data further suggest that Sox D and E genes are involved in mesoderm differentiation, and that Sox E genes are involved in gonadal development. The new data expand our knowledge about the expression and implied function of Sox genes to Mandibulata (Myriapoda+Pancrustacea) and Panarthropoda (Arthropoda+Onychophora).},

	abstract = {Sox proteins are found in all metazoans and are active in many developmental processes. Their function as transcription factors is governed by their DNA-binding properties as much as by their interactions with other transcription factors and cofactors, and subject to modulation by posttranslational modifications. Although most Sox proteins predominantly function as transcriptional activators, there is also evidence for transcriptional repression and architectural roles. Further effects involve complex formation of Sox proteins with transcriptionally relevant factors off DNA. Sox proteins may be additionally active on the posttranscriptional level and are therefore remarkably versatile regulators of gene expression.},

	doi = {10.1186/gb-2014-15-5-r74},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sox proteins encompass an evolutionarily conserved family of transcription factors with critical roles in animal development and stem cell biology. In common with vertebrates, the Drosophila group B proteins SoxNeuro and Dichaete are involved in central nervous system development, where they play both similar and unique roles in gene regulation. Sox genes show extensive functional redundancy across metazoans, but the molecular basis underpinning functional compensation mechanisms at the genomic level are currently unknown.
RESULTS: Using a combination of genome-wide binding analysis and gene expression profiling, we show that SoxNeuro directs embryonic neural development from the early specification of neuroblasts through to the terminal differentiation of neurons and glia. To address the issue of functional redundancy and compensation at a genomic level, we compare SoxNeuro and Dichaete binding, identifying common and independent binding events in wild-type conditions, as well as instances of compensation and loss of binding in mutant backgrounds.
CONCLUSIONS: We find that early aspects of group B Sox functions in the central nervous system, such as stem cell maintenance and dorsoventral patterning, are highly conserved. However, in contrast to vertebrates, we find that Drosophila group B1 proteins also play prominent roles during later aspects of neural morphogenesis. Our analysis of the functional relationship between SoxNeuro and Dichaete uncovers evidence for redundant and independent functions for each protein, along with unexpected examples of compensation and interdependency, thus providing new insights into the general issue of transcription factor functional redundancy.},

	abstract = {In the Drosophila embryonic central nervous system, neural stem cells, called neuroblasts, acquire fates in a position-specific manner. Recent work has identified a set of genes that functions along the dorsoventral axis to enable neuroblasts that develop in different dorsoventral domains to acquire distinct fates. These genes include the evolutionarily conserved transcription factors ventral nerve cord defective and intermediate neuroblasts defective, as well as the Drosophila EGF receptor. We show that the Sox-domain-containing gene Dichaete/fish-hook also plays a crucial role to pattern the neuroectoderm along the DV axis. Dichaete is expressed in the medial and intermediate columns of the neuroectoderm, and mutant analysis indicates that Dichaete regulates cell fate and neuroblast formation in these domains. Molecular epistasis tests, double mutant analysis and dosage-sensitive interactions demonstrate that during these processes, Dichaete functions in parallel with ventral nerve cord defective and intermediate neuroblasts defective, and downstream of EGF receptor signaling to mediate its effect on development. These results identify Dichaete as an important regulator of dorsoventral pattern in the neuroectoderm, and indicate that Dichaete acts in concert with ventral nerve cord defective and intermediate neuroblasts defective to regulate pattern and cell fate in the neuroectoderm.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sox (Sry-related high-mobility-group box) genes represent important factors in animal development. Relatively little, however, is known about the embryonic expression patterns and thus possible function(s) of Sox genes during ontogenesis in panarthropods (Arthropoda+Tardigrada+Onychophora). To date, studies have been restricted exclusively to higher insects, including the model system Drosophila melanogaster, with no comprehensive data available for any other arthropod group, or any tardigrade or onychophoran.
RESULTS: This study provides a phylogenetic analysis of panarthropod Sox genes and presents the first comprehensive analysis of embryonic expression patterns in the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Hexapoda), the pill millipede Glomeris marginata (Myriapoda), and the velvet worm, Euperipatoides kanangrensis (Onychophora). 24 Sox genes were identified and investigated: 7 in Euperipatoides, 8 in Glomeris, and 9 in Tribolium. Each species possesses at least one ortholog of each of the five expected Sox gene families, B, C, D, E, and F, many of which are differentially expressed during ontogenesis.
CONCLUSION: Sox gene expression (and potentially function) is highly conserved in arthropods and their closest relatives, the onychophorans. Sox B, C and D class genes appear to be crucial for nervous system development, while the Sox B genes Dichaete (D) and Sox21b likely play an additional conserved role in panarthropod segmentation. The Sox B gene Sox21a likely has a conserved function in foregut and Malpighian tubule development, at least in Hexapoda. The data further suggest that Sox D and E genes are involved in mesoderm differentiation, and that Sox E genes are involved in gonadal development. The new data expand our knowledge about the expression and implied function of Sox genes to Mandibulata (Myriapoda+Pancrustacea) and Panarthropoda (Arthropoda+Onychophora).},

While Dichaete does not appear to be involved in spider segmentation, we found that the closely related Sox21b-1 gene acts as a gap gene during formation of anterior segments and is also part of the segmentation clock for development of the segment addition zone and sequential addition of opisthosomal segments. Thus, we have found that two different mechanisms of segmentation in a non-mandibulate arthropod are regulated by a SoxB gene. Our work provides new insights into the function of an important and conserved gene family, and the evolution of the regulation of segmentation in arthropods.},

We collected and analyzed data for Sox group B from 36 species of 12 phyla representing the major metazoan clades, with an emphasis on arthropods, to reconstruct the evolutionary history of SoxB in bilaterians and to date the expansion of Sox group B in insects. We found that the genome of the bilaterian last common ancestor probably contained one SoxB1 and one SoxB2 gene only and that tandem duplications of SoxB2 occurred before the arthropod diversification but after the arthropod-nematode divergence, resulting in the basal repertoire of Sox group B in diverse arthropod lineages. The arthropod Sox group B repertoire expanded differently from the vertebrate repertoire, which resulted from genome duplications. The parallel increases in the Sox group B repertoires of the arthropods and vertebrates are consistent with the parallel increases in the complexity and diversification of these two important organismal groups.},

Long-germ insects, such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, pattern their segments simultaneously, whereas short-germ insects, such as the beetle Tribolium castaneum, pattern their segments sequentially, from anterior to posterior. Although the two modes of segmentation at first appear quite distinct, much of this difference might simply reflect developmental heterochrony. We now show here that, in both Drosophila and Tribolium, segment patterning occurs within a common framework of sequential Caudal, Dichaete and Odd-paired expression. In Drosophila, these transcription factors are expressed like simple timers within the blastoderm, whereas in Tribolium they form wavefronts that sweep from anterior to posterior across the germband. In Drosophila, all three are known to regulate pair-rule gene expression and influence the temporal progression of segmentation. We propose that these regulatory roles are conserved in short-germ embryos, and that therefore the changing expression profiles of these genes across insects provide a mechanistic explanation for observed differences in the timing of segmentation. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate that Odd-paired is essential for segmentation in Tribolium, contrary to previous reports.},

Tunicates and lancelets are evolutionarily positioned as the closest invertebrate relatives to the vertebrate group.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Group B Sox domain transcription factors play conserved roles in the specification and development of the nervous system in higher metazoans. However, we know comparatively little about how these transcription factors regulate gene expression, and the analysis of Sox gene function in vertebrates is confounded by functional compensation between three closely related family members. In Drosophila, only two group B Sox genes, Dichaete and SoxN, have been shown to function during embryonic CNS development, providing a simpler system for understanding the functions of this important class of regulators.
RESULTS: Using a combination of transcriptional profiling and genome-wide binding analysis we conservatively identify over 1000 high confidence direct Dichaete target genes in the Drosophila genome. We show that Dichaete plays key roles in CNS development, regulating aspects of the temporal transcription factor sequence that confer neuroblast identity. Dichaete also shows a complex interaction with Prospero in the pathway controlling the switch from stem cell self-renewal to neural differentiation. Dichaete potentially regulates many more genes in the Drosophila genome and was found to be associated with over 2000 mapped regulatory elements.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that Dichaete acts as a transcriptional hub, controlling multiple regulatory pathways during CNS development. These include a set of core CNS expressed genes that are also bound by the related Sox2 gene during mammalian CNS development. Furthermore, we identify Dichaete as one of the transcription factors involved in the neural stem cell transcriptional network, with evidence supporting the view that Dichaete is involved in controlling the temporal series of divisions regulating neuroblast identity.},

	abstract = {Group B Sox genes, Sox1, -2 and -3 are known to activate crystallin genes and to be involved in differentiation of lens and neural tissues. Screening of chicken genomic sequences for more Group B Sox genes identified two additional genes, Sox14 and Sox21. Proteins encoded by Sox14 and Sox21 genes are similar to each other but distinct from those coded by Sox1-3 (subgroup B1) except for the HMG domain and Group B homology immediately C-proximal of the HMG domain. C-terminal domains of SOX21 and SOX14 proteins function as strong and weak repression domains, respectively, when linked to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. These SOX proteins strongly (SOX21) or moderately (SOX14) inhibited activation of delta1-crystallin DC5 enhancer by SOX1 or SOX2, establishing that Sox14 and Sox21 are repressing subgroup (B2) of Group B Sox genes. This provides the first evidence for the occurrence of repressor SOX proteins. Activating (B1) and repressing (B2) subgroups of Group B Sox genes display interesting overlaps of expression domains in developing tissues (e.g. optic tectum, spinal cord, inner ear, alimentary tract, branchial arches). Within each subgroup, most expression domains of Sox1 and -3 are included in those of Sox2 (e.g. CNS, PNS, inner ear), while co-expression of Sox14 and Sox21 occurs in highly restricted sites of the CNS, with the likely temporal order of Sox21 preceding Sox14 (e.g. interneurons of the spinal cord). These expression patterns suggest that target genes of Group B SOX proteins are finely regulated by the counterbalance of activating and repressing SOX proteins.},

Shared functions for the Sox1, Sox2 and Sox3 protein products have also been indicated. This emphasizes the importance and integral role of the group B1 Sox genes in regulating the neural primordia. We here review what is currently known about the expression patterns of both the group B1 Sox genes and the related group B2 Sox21 gene during the embryonic stages when the neural plate develops. These expression profiles are compared between the chicken and mouse embryos, both representatives of amniote species. This comparison indicates a gross conservation of the regulation of individual Sox genes, yet also demonstrates the existence of species-dependent variations, which should be taken into account when data from different species are being compared. To link the expression patterns and transcriptional regulation of these genes, contribution of gene-specific enhancers are discussed. The regulation of B1 Sox genes in the axial stem cells, the common precursors to the posterior neural plate and paraxial mesoderm and located at the posterior end of developing neural plate, is also highlighted in this review. This article thus provides a guide to performing readouts of B1/B2 Sox expression data during neural plate development in amniotes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sox domain containing genes are important metazoan transcriptional regulators implicated in a wide rage of developmental processes. The vertebrate B subgroup contains the Sox1, Sox2 and Sox3 genes that have early functions in neural development. Previous studies show that Drosophila Group B genes have been functionally conserved since they play essential roles in early neural specification and mutations in the Drosophila Dichaete and SoxN genes can be rescued with mammalian Sox genes. Despite their importance, the extent and organisation of the Group B family in Drosophila has not been fully characterised, an important step in using Drosophila to examine conserved aspects of Group B Sox gene function.
RESULTS: We have used the directed cDNA sequencing along with the output from the publicly-available genome sequencing projects to examine the structure of Group B Sox domain genes in Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura, Anopheles gambiae and Apis mellifora. All of the insect genomes contain four genes encoding Group B proteins, two of which are intronless, as is the case with vertebrate group B genes. As has been previously reported and unusually for Group B genes, two of the insect group B genes, Sox21a and Sox21b, contain introns within their DNA-binding domains. We find that the highly unusual multi-exon structure of the Sox21b gene is common to the insects. In addition, we find that three of the group B Sox genes are organised in a linked cluster in the insect genomes. By in situ hybridisation we show that the pattern of expression of each of the four group B genes during embryogenesis is conserved between D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura.
CONCLUSION: The DNA-binding domain sequences and genomic organisation of the group B genes have been conserved over 300 My of evolution since the last common ancestor of the Hymenoptera and the Diptera. Our analysis suggests insects have two Group B1 genes, SoxN and Dichaete, and two Group B2 genes. The genomic organisation of Dichaete and another two Group B genes in a cluster, suggests they may be under concerted regulatory control. Our analysis suggests a simple model for the evolution of group B Sox genes in insects that differs from the proposed evolution of vertebrate Group B genes.},

Dichaete is expressed in early embryos in a dynamic pattern reminiscent of gap and pair-rule genes and is required for the appropriate expression of the primary pair-rule genes even skipped, hairy and runt. The molecular nature of Dichaete and its expression pattern during early embryogenesis suggest that the gene plays a key role in early development; the variability in both the segmentation phenotype and the effects on pair-rule gene expression suggests that this role is to support the transcriptional regulation of key developmental genes rather than directly regulate any one of them.},

The Dichaete gene of Drosophila encodes a group B Sox protein related to mammalian Sox1, -2, and -3 and, like these proteins, it is widely and dynamically expressed throughout embryogenesis. In order to unravel new Dichaete functions, we characterized the organization of the Dichaete gene using a combination of regulatory mutant alleles and reporter gene constructs. Dichaete expression is tightly controlled during embryonic development by a complex of regulatory elements distributed over 25 kb downstream and 3 kb upstream of the transcription unit. A series of regulatory alleles which affect tissue-specific domains of Dichaete were used to demonstrate that Dichaete has functions in addition to those during segmentation and midline development previously described. First, Dichaete has functions in the developing brain. A specific group of neural cells in the tritocerebrum fails to develop correctly in the absence of Dichaete, as revealed by reduced expression of labial, zfh-2, wingless, and engrailed. Second, Dichaete is required for the correct differentiation of the hindgut. The Dichaete requirement in hindgut morphogenesis is, in part, via regulation of dpp, since ectopically supplied dpp can rescue Dichaete phenotypes in the hindgut. Taken together, there are now four distinct in vivo functions described for Dichaete that can be used as models for context-dependent comparative studies of Sox function.},

Sox proteins form a family of HMG-box transcription factors related to the mammalian testis determining factor SRY. Sox-mediated modulation of gene expression plays an important role in various developmental contexts. Drosophila SoxNeuro, a putative ortholog of the vertebrate Sox1, Sox2 and Sox3 proteins, is one of the earliest transcription factors to be expressed pan-neuroectodermally. We demonstrate that SoxNeuro is essential for the formation of the neural progenitor cells in central nervous system. We show that loss of function mutations of SoxNeuro are associated with a spatially restricted hypoplasia: neuroblast formation is severely affected in the lateral and intermediate regions of the central nervous system, whereas ventral neuroblast formation is almost normal. We present evidence that a requirement for SoxNeuro in ventral neuroblast formation is masked by a functional redundancy with Dichaete, a second Sox protein whose expression partially overlaps that of SoxNeuro. Genetic interactions of SoxNeuro and the dorsoventral patterning genes ventral nerve chord defective and intermediate neuroblasts defective underlie ventral and intermediate neuroblast formation. Finally, the expression of the Achaete-Scute gene complex suggests that SoxNeuro acts upstream and in parallel with the proneural genes.},

Different classes of Sox transcription factors are expressed during neurogenesis and have been assigned important roles from early lineage specification to neuronal differentiation. Here we characterize the genome-wide binding for Sox2, Sox3, and Sox11, which have vital functions in ES cells, neural precursor cells (NPCs), and maturing neurons, respectively. The data demonstrate that Sox factor binding depends on developmental stage-specific constraints and reveal a remarkable sequential binding of Sox proteins to a common set of neural genes. Interestingly, in ES cells, Sox2 preselects for neural lineage-specific genes destined to be bound and activated by Sox3 in NPCs. In NPCs, Sox3 binds genes that are later bound and activated by Sox11 in differentiating neurons. Genes prebound by Sox proteins are associated with a bivalent chromatin signature, which is resolved into a permissive monovalent state upon binding of activating Sox factors. These data indicate that a single key transcription factor family acts sequentially to coordinate neural gene expression from the early lineage specification in pluripotent cells to later stages of neuronal development.},

SOX proteins belonging to the same group tend to have overlapping tissue expression profiles and are able to functionally substitute for one another. However, SOX proteins belonging to different groups often do not show redundant regulatory functions. To achieve their specific actions, SOX proteins rely on interactions with a wide variety of proteins. The choice of binding partners as well as post-translational modifications of SOX proteins confers target gene specificity to the HMG box proteins which otherwise have weak DNA binding specificity. SOX proteins also regulate signalling pathways, such as the Wnt pathway by interacting with beta-catenin and/or TCF/LEF transcription factors, employing different mechanisms to achieve similar functional outcomes.

	abstract = {The HMG-domain containing transcription factor Sox10 is essential for neural crest (NC) development and for oligodendrocyte differentiation. Heterozygous SOX10 mutations in humans lead to corresponding defects in several NC-derived lineages and to leukodystrophies. Disease phenotypes range from Waardenburg syndrome and Waardenburg-Hirschsprung disease to Peripheral demyelinating neuropathy, Central dysmyelination, Waardenburg syndrome and Hirschsprung disease (PCWH). The phenotypic variability can partly be explained by the action of modifier genes, but is also influenced by the mutation that leads to haploinsufficiency in some and to mutant SOX10 proteins with altered properties in other cases. Here, we used in ovo electroporation in the developing neural tube of chicken to determine which regions and properties of SOX10 are required for early NC development. We found a strict reliance on the DNA-binding activity and the presence of the C-terminal transactivation domain and a lesser influence of the dimerization function and a conserved domain in the center of the protein. Intriguingly, dominant-negative effects on early NC development were mostly observed for truncated SOX10 proteins whose production in patients is probably prevented by nonsense-mediated decay. In contrast, mutant SOX10 proteins that occur in patients were usually inactive. Any dominant negative activity which some of these mutants undoubtedly possess must, therefore, be restricted to single NC-derived cell lineages or oligodendrocytes at later times. This contributes to the phenotypic variability of human SOX10 mutations.},

Subsequently, cells of the neurectoderm are internalized and form a cell layer of proliferating neural progenitors. In vertebrates, the entire neurectoderm folds into the embryo to give rise to the neural tube. In Drosophila and many other invertebrates, a subset of neurectodermal cells, called neuroblasts (NBs), delaminates and forms the neural primordium inside the embryo where they divide in an asymmetric, stem cell-like mode. The remainder of the neurectodermal cells that stay behind at the surface loose their neurogenic potential and later give rise to the ventral part of the epidermis. The genetic and molecular analysis of the mechanisms controlling specification and proliferation of NBs in the Drosophila embryo, which played a significant part in pioneering the field of modern developmental neurobiology, represents the topic of this review.},

Analogous to the search function in modern word processors, Cas9 can be guided to specific locations within complex genomes by a short RNA search string. Using this system, DNA sequences within the endogenous genome and their functional outputs are now easily edited or modulated in virtually any organism of choice. Cas9-mediated genetic perturbation is simple and scalable, empowering researchers to elucidate the functional organization of the genome at the systems level and establish causal linkages between genetic variations and biological phenotypes. In this Review, we describe the development and applications of Cas9 for a variety of research or translational applications while highlighting challenges as well as future directions. Derived from a remarkable microbial defense system, Cas9 is driving innovative applications from basic biology to biotechnology and medicine.},

We show here that in a subset of these systems, the mature crRNA that is base-paired to trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) forms a two-RNA structure that directs the CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 to introduce double-stranded (ds) breaks in target DNA. At sites complementary to the crRNA-guide sequence, the Cas9 HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand, whereas the Cas9 RuvC-like domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand. The dual-tracrRNA:crRNA, when engineered as a single RNA chimera, also directs sequence-specific Cas9 dsDNA cleavage. Our study reveals a family of endonucleases that use dual-RNAs for site-specific DNA cleavage and highlights the potential to exploit the system for RNA-programmable genome editing.

Each SOX-partner pair selects a specific group of regulatory target genes, with resultant gene expression patterns characterizing a particular cell differentiation state. Specific examples include the SOX2-OCT3/4 pairing in ES cells and the SOX2-PAX6 pairing in visual system primordia. When a component of a SOX-partner pair is exchanged with another factor, an overt transition of gene expression occurs in a cell, leading to the progression of developmental processes. When a SOX-partner protein pair activates its own genes, the global cell/tissue state is stabilized. Two major molecular mechanisms underlie SOX-partner factor interactions: (1) cooperative DNA binding; and (2) protein interactions dependent upon DNA binding which elicit a large transactivation potential.

These are essential decisions that every cell is constantly challenged to make in multi-cellular organisms to ensure proper development, adult maintenance, and adaptability. SRY-related high-mobility-group box (Sox) transcription factors have emerged in the animal kingdom to help cells effect such decisions. They are encoded by 20 genes in humans and mice. They share a highly conserved high-mobility-group box domain that was originally identified in SRY, the sex-determining gene on the Y chromosome, and that has derived from a canonical high-mobility-group domain characteristic of chromatin-associated proteins. The high-mobility-group box domain binds DNA in the minor groove and increases its DNA binding affinity and specificity by interacting with many types of transcription factors. It also bends DNA and may thereby confer on Sox proteins a unique and critical role in the assembly of transcriptional enhanceosomes. Sox proteins fall into eight groups. Most feature a transactivation or transrepression domain and thereby also act as typical transcription factors. Each gene has distinct expression pattern and molecular properties, often redundant with those in the same group and overlapping with those in other groups. As a whole the Sox family controls cell fate and differentiation in a multitude of processes, such as male differentiation, stemness, neurogenesis, and skeletogenesis. We review their specific molecular properties and in vivo roles, stress recent advances in the field, and suggest directions for future investigations.},

CNS midline development is dependent on Single-minded (Sim), a basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-PAS transcription factor. We show here that Fish-hook (Fish), a Sox HMG domain protein, and Drifter (Dfr), a POU domain protein, act in concert with Single-minded to control midline gene expression. single-minded,fish-hook, and drifter are all expressed in developing midline cells, and both loss- and gain-of-function assays revealed genetic interactions between these genes. The corresponding proteins bind to DNA sites present in a 1 kb midline enhancer from theslit gene and regulate the activity of this enhancer in cultured Drosophila Schneider line 2 cells. Fish-hook directly associates with the PAS domain of Single-minded and the POU domain of Drifter; the three proteins can together form a ternary complex in yeast. In addition, Fish can form homodimers and also associates with other bHLH-PAS and POU proteins. These results indicate that midline gene regulation involves the coordinate functions of three distinct types of transcription factors. Functional interactions between members of these protein families may be important for numerous developmental and physiological processes.},

A candidate gene for human sex determination (SRY) was isolated in this region. Here, we describe a study of 25 cases of XY females with pure gonadal dysgenesis for mutations on the Y chromosome short arm, including SRY. Southern blotting revealed a sex-reversed female harboring a deletion extending from approximately 8 kb from the pseudoautosomal boundary of the Y chromosome to at least 33 kb and no more than 60 kb upstream, toward the centromere. The deletion begins no more than 1.8 kb upstream from the first ATG of the SRY open reading frame present in the clone pY53.3. To our knowledge, no mutation has been described previously outside the SRY "HMG box" on the short arm of the Y chromosome, which is associated with sex reversal. Since the 5' extent of the SRY transcriptional unit has not been defined, the deletion may remove upstream exons of SRY and/or transcriptional regulatory motifs, either situation resulting in lack of testicular development. It cannot be formally excluded that the mutation removes a second locus, independent of SRY, that is critical for sex determination. Denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of the SRY open reading frame in the remaining 24 cases revealed de novo single base-pair transitions in the SRY conserved domain in 4 cases.},

	abstract = {The Drosophila embryonic Central Nervous System (CNS) develops from the ventrolateral region of the embryo, the neuroectoderm. Neuroblasts arise from the neuroectoderm and acquire unique fates based on the positions in which they are formed. Previous work has identified six genes that pattern the dorsoventral axis of the neuroectoderm: Drosophila epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr), ventral nerve cord defective (vnd), intermediate neuroblast defective (ind), muscle segment homeobox (msh), Dichaete and Sox-Neuro (SoxN). The activities of these genes partition the early neuroectoderm into three parallel longitudinal columns (medial, intermediate, lateral) from which three distinct columns of neural stem cells arise. Most of our knowledge of the regulatory relationships among these genes derives from classical loss of function analyses. To gain a more in depth understanding of Egfr-mediated regulation of vnd, ind and msh and investigate potential cross-regulatory interactions among these genes, we combined loss of function with ectopic activation of Egfr activity. We observe that ubiquitous activation of Egfr expands the expression of vnd and ind into the lateral column and reduces that of msh in the lateral column. Through this work, we identified the genetic criteria required for the development of the medial and intermediate column cell fates. We also show that ind appears to repress vnd, adding an additional layer of complexity to the genetic regulatory hierarchy that patterns the dorsoventral axis of the CNS. Finally, we demonstrate that Egfr and the genes of the achaete-scute complex act in parallel to regulate the individual fate of neural stem cells.},

	abstract = {Wnt signaling specifies cell fates in many tissues during vertebrate and invertebrate embryogenesis. To understand better how Wnt signaling is regulated during development, we have performed genetic screens to isolate mutations that suppress or enhance mutations in the fly Wnt homolog, wingless (wg). We find that loss-of-function mutations in the neural determinant SoxNeuro (also known as Sox-neuro, SoxN) partially suppress wg mutant pattern defects. SoxN encodes a HMG-box-containing protein related to the vertebrate Sox1, Sox2 and Sox3 proteins, which have been implicated in patterning events in the early mouse embryo. In Drosophila, SoxN has previously been shown to specify neural progenitors in the embryonic central nervous system. Here, we show that SoxN negatively regulates Wg pathway activity in the embryonic epidermis. Loss of SoxN function hyperactivates the Wg pathway, whereas its overexpression represses pathway activity. Epistasis analysis with other components of the Wg pathway places SoxN at the level of the transcription factor Pan (also known as Lef, Tcf) in regulating target gene expression. In human cell culture assays, SoxN represses Tcf-responsive reporter expression, indicating that the fly gene product can interact with mammalian Wnt pathway components. In both flies and in human cells, SoxN repression is potentiated by adding ectopic Tcf, suggesting that SoxN interacts with the repressor form of Tcf to influence Wg/Wnt target gene transcription.},

The 30-bp sequence of the enhancer including these sites (Nes30) showed a nervous system-specific and SOX-POU-dependent enhancer activity in multimeric forms in transfection assays and was utilized in assessing the specificity of the synergism; combinations of either group B1 or group C SOX (SOX11) with class III POU proved effective. In embryonic day 13.5 mouse spinal cord, Nestin was expressed in the cells with nuclei in the ventricular and subventricular zones. SOX1/2/3 expression was confined to the nuclei of the ventricular zone; SOX11 localized to the nuclei of both subventricular (high-level expression) and intermediate (low-level expression) zones. Class III POU (Brn2) was expressed at high levels, localizing to the nucleus in the ventricular and subventricular zones; moderate expression was observed in the intermediate zone, distributed in the cytoplasm.

Each SOX–partner pair selects a specific group of regulatory target genes, with resultant gene expression patterns characterizing a particular cell differentiation state. Specific examples include the SOX2–OCT3/4 pairing in ES cells and the SOX2–PAX6 pairing in visual system primordia. When a component of a SOX–partner pair is exchanged with another factor, an overt transition of gene expression occurs in a cell, leading to the progression of developmental processes. When a SOX–partner protein pair activates its own genes, the global cell/tissue state is stabilized. Two major molecular mechanisms underlie SOX–partner factor interactions: (1) cooperative DNA binding; and (2) protein interactions dependent upon DNA binding which elicit a large transactivation potential.

Trichomes are cytoplasmic extrusions of epidermal cells. The molecular mechanisms that govern the differentiation of trichome-producing cells are conserved across species as distantly related as mice and flies. Several signaling pathways converge onto the regulation of a conserved target gene, shavenbaby (svb, ovo), which, in turn, stimulates trichome formation. The Drosophila ventral epidermis consists of the segmental alternation of two cell types that produce either naked cuticle or trichomes called denticles. The binary choice to produce naked cuticle or denticles is affected by the transcriptional regulation of svb, which is sufficient to cell-autonomously direct denticle formation. The expression of svb is regulated by the opposing gradients of two signaling molecules - the epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) ligand Spitz (Spi), which activates svb expression, and Wingless (Wg), which represses it. It has remained unclear how these opposing signals are integrated to establish a distinct domain of svb expression. We show that the expression of the high mobility group (HMG)-domain protein SoxNeuro (SoxN) is activated by Spi, and repressed by Wg, signaling. SoxN is necessary and sufficient to cell-autonomously direct the expression of svb. The closely related protein Dichaete is co-regulated with SoxN and has a partially redundant function in the activation of svb expression. In addition, we show that SoxN and Dichaete function upstream of Wg and antagonize Wg pathway activity. This suggests that the expression of svb in a discreet domain is resolved at the level of SoxN and Dichaete.},

 combination on DNA is considered to direct the establishment of the first

 structure determination, followed by model building and experimental
 validation, we found that Oct4 and Sox2 were able to dimerize onto DNA in
 distinct conformational arrangements. We demonstrate that the DNA enhancer
 region of their target genes is responsible for the correct spatial alignment
 of glue-like interaction domains on their surface. Interestingly, these
 surfaces frequently have redundant functions and are instrumental in
 recruiting various interacting protein partners.},

The HMG domain is a DNA-binding and DNA-bending motif comprising about 80 amino acid residues. It has been shown that SRY and SOX9 are nuclear proteins. Using normal or mutant SRY-beta-galactosidase and SOX9-beta-galactosidase fusion proteins in transfection studies involving COS-7 cells, we have identified two nuclear localization signals (NLSs) within the HMG domains of both proteins that can independently direct the fusion proteins into the nucleus. Only mutational inactivation of both NLS motifs resulted in complete exclusion of the fusion proteins from the nucleus. The NLS sequences are located at the N and C termini of the HMG domain and are a bipartite NLS motif and a basic cluster NLS motif, respectively. Both NLS motifs are conserved in the HMG domains of other transcription factors. The implications of the present results are discussed regarding (a) the apparent dual function of certain basic amino acid residues in the HMG domain of SRY in both DNA binding and in nuclear localization and (b) the possible control of SOX9 in early gonadal differentiation at the level of nuclear translocation.},

Sox5 hinders melanogenesis, promotes neural crest generation, and controls the pace of neurogenesis. Sox6 promotes erythropoiesis, and Sox13 modulates T cell specification and is an autoimmune antigen. SoxD proteins enhance transactivation by Sox9 in chondrocytes, but antagonize Sox9 and other SoxE proteins in oligodendrocytes and melanocytes, and also repress transcription through various mechanisms in several other lineages. While their biological and molecular functions remain incompletely understood, the SoxD proteins have thus already proven that they critically modulate cell fate in major lineages.},

As skeletogenesis unfolds, SOXC proteins ensure cartilage primordia delineation by amplifying canonical WNT signaling and antagonizing the chondrogenic action of SOX9 in perichondrium and presumptive articular joint cells. They then ensure skeletal elongation by inducing growth plate formation via enabling non-canonical WNT signaling. Human studies have associated SOX4 with bone mineral density and fracture risk in osteoporotic patients, and SOX11 with Coffin-Siris, a syndrome that includes skeletal dysmorphism. Meanwhile, in vitro and mouse studies have suggested important cell-autonomous roles for SOXC proteins in osteoblastogenesis.

	abstract = {In mammals, sex determination defines the differentiation of the bipotential genital ridge into either testes or ovaries. Sry, the mammalian Y-chromosomal testis-determining gene, is a master regulator of male sex determination. It acts to switch the undifferentiated genital ridge towards testis development, triggering the adoption of a male fate. Sry initiates a cascade of gene networks through the direct regulation of Sox9 expression and promotes supporting cell differentiation, Leydig cell specification, vasculature formation and testis cord development. In the absence of Sry, alternative genetic cascades, including female sex-determining genes RSPO1, Wnt4/beta-catenin and Foxl2, are involved in the formation of female genitalia and the maintenance of female ovarian development. The mutual antagonisms between male and female sex-determining pathways are crucial in not just the initiation but also the maintenance of the somatic sex of the gonad throughout the organism’s lifetime. Any imbalances in above sex-determining genes can cause disorders of sex development in humans and mice. In this review, we provide a detailed summary of the expression profiles, biochemical properties and developmental functions of Sry and SoxE genes in embryonic testis development and adult gonadal development. We also briefly summarize the dedicate balances between male and female sex-determining genes in mammalian sex development, with particular highlights on the molecular actions of Sry and Sox9 transcription factors.},

	abstract = {Although gonads are not required for development or survival, defects in gonadal development undoubtedly have a profound influence on affected individuals. Recent complementary studies in the fields of cytology, biochemistry and molecular genetics have revealed that normal gonad development involves an exquisitely regulated network of gene expression and protein–protein interactions. The initial event of gonadogenesis, in both males and females, involves the formation of a bipotential primordium. A Y chromosome then activates the male-specific pathway. The demonstration that mutations in the SOX proteins, SRY and SOX9, are responsible for disorders associated with male-to-female sex reversal showed dramatically that SRY and SOX9 have an essential role in male sex differentiation. This was emphasized when it was shown that female mice carrying transgenes that encode these proteins developed as males. SRY and SOX9 proteins have been characterized extensively and aspects of their function and regulation are now known.},

	abstract = {The general view of development consists of the acquisition of committed/differentiated phenotypes following a period of self-renewal and progenitor expansion. Lineage specification and progression are phenomena of antagonistic events, silencing tissue-specific gene expression in precursors to allow self-renewal and multipotentiality, and subsequently suppressing proliferation and embryonic gene expression to promote the restricted expression of tissue-specific genes during maturation. The high mobility group-containing Sox family of transcription factors constitutes one of the earliest classes of genes to be expressed during embryonic development. These proteins are not only indispensable for progenitor cell specification, but are also critical for terminal differentiation of multiple cell types in a wide variety of lineages. Sox transcription factors are now known to induce or repress progenitor cell characteristics and cell proliferation, or activate the expression of tissue-specific genes. Sox proteins fulfill their diverse functions in developmental regulation by distinct molecular mechanisms. Not surprisingly, in addition to DNA binding and bending, Sox transcription factors also interact with different protein partners to function as co-activators or co-repressors of downstream target genes. In this article, we seek to provide an overview of the current knowledge of Sox gene functional mechanisms, in an effort to understand their roles in both development and pathology.},

Combination of lineage analysis and hepatic injury experiments showed involvement of Sox9-positive precursors in liver regeneration. Embryonic pancreatic Sox9-expressing cells differentiate into all types of mature cells, but their capacity for endocrine differentiation diminishes shortly after birth, when endocrine cells detach from the epithelial lining of the ducts and form the islets of Langerhans. We observed a developmental switch in the hepatic progenitor cell type from Sox9-negative to Sox9-positive progenitors as the biliary tree develops.

VEGF-C, D, FOXC2, Prox 1, and SOX18 are known to play central roles in lymphatic development. We investigated the expression of regulatory molecules for lymphangiogenesis in the duodenal mucosa of idiopathic intestinal lymphangiectasia. Methods: Biopsy samples were obtained from duodenal biopsies in patients with intestinal lymphangiectasia complicated with protein-losing from white spot lesions in which lymphangiectasia was histologically confirmed. Immunohistochemical analysis for VEGFR3 and LYVE-1 was performed. mRNA expression of VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGFR3, and transcription factors was determined by the quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction method. Results: In the control mucosa, VEGFR3 was weakly expressed on the central lymphatic vessels in the lamina propria and LYVE-1 was expressed mainly on the lymphatic vessels in the submucosa. In intestinal lymphangiectasia, VEGFR3 and LYVE-1 expression levels were increased on the mucosal surface corresponding to widely dilated lymphatic vessels, while they were decreased in the deeper mucosa. mRNA expression study showed a significant increase in the expression level of VEGFR3 in lymphangiectasia, but the expression of VEGF-C and -D mRNA was significantly suppressed compared with that in controls despite the presence of lymphangiectasia. The mRNA expression levels of FOXC2 and SOX18 were also decreased, whereas Prox 1 was not altered. Conclusions: There is an altered expression of regulatory molecules for lymphangiogenesis in the duodenal mucosa in these patients.},

	abstract = {The SRY gene on the mammalian Y chromosome undoubtedly acts to determine testis, but it is still quite unclear how. It was originally supposed that SRY acts directly to activate other genes in the testis-determining pathway. This paper presents an alternative hypothesis that SRY functions indirectly, by interacting with related genes SOX3 (from which SRY evolved) and SOX9 (which appears to be intimately involved in vertebrate gonad differentiation). Specifically, I propose that in females SOX3 inhibits SOX9 function, but in males, SRY inhibits SOX3 and permits SOX9 to enact its testis-determining role. This hypothesis makes testable predictions of the phenotypes of XX and XY individuals with deficiencies or overproduction of any of the three genes, and is able to account for the difficult cases of XX(SRY−) males and transdifferentiation in the absence of SRY. The hypothesis also suggests a way that the dominant SRY sex-determining system of present-day mammals may have evolved from an ancient system relying on SOX3 dosage.

	abstract = {Fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF-4) has been shown to be a signaling molecule whose expression is essential for postimplantation mouse development and, at later embryonic stages, for limb patterning and growth. The FGF-4 gene is expressed in the blastocyst inner cell mass and later in distinct embryonic tissues but is transcriptionally silent in the adult. In tissue culture FGF-4 expression is restricted to undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells and embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell lines. Previously, we determined that EC cell-specific transcriptional activation of the FGF-4 gene depends on a synergistic interaction between octamer-binding proteins and an EC-specific factor, Fx, that bind adjacent sites on the FGF-4 enhancer. Through the cloning and characterization of an F9 cell cDNA we now show that the latter activity is Sox2, a member of the Sry-related Sox factors family. Sox2 can form a ternary complex with either the ubiquitous Oct-1 or the embryonic-specific Oct-3 protein on FGF-4 enhancer DNA sequences. However, only the Sox2/Oct-3 complex is able to promote transcriptional activation. These findings identify FGF-4 as the first known embryonic target gene for Oct-3 and for any of the Sox factors, and offer insights into the mechanisms of selective gene activation by Sox and octamer-binding proteins during embryogenesis.},

	abstract = {When the cloning era arrived, our first target for cloning was the delta1-crystallin gene of the chicken, the lens-specific gene expressed earliest following lens induction. We have investigated the regulation of this gene with the idea that the mechanism of its activation must reflect that of lens differentiation per se. We here summarize the investigation carried out in our group along this line over the past 20 years. The delta1-crystallin gene is regulated by an enhancer in the third intron, and the specificity of this regulation is governed by a DNA region (called DC5) of only 30 bp DNA bound by two transcription factors. These factors have been identified as SOX1/2/3 (Group B1 SOX proteins, SOX2 being the major player) and Pax6, and have been shown to bind cooperatively to DC5 and form a ternary complex having a robust potency for transcriptional activation. In the embryo, Pax6 is widely expressed in the head ectoderm before the lens is formed, and as the optic vesicle comes into contact with the ectoderm, SOX2/3 expression is induced in the contacted area of the ectoderm, thereby allowing Pax6 and SOX2/3 to meet in the same cell nucleus, where they can then activate a battery of genes for early lens development including delta1-crystallin. Thus, the cooperative action of Pax6 and SOX2 initiates lens differentiation. More broadly, SOX1/2/3 interact with various partner transcription factors, and participate in defining distinct cell states that depend on the partner factors: Pax6 for lens differentiation, Oct3/4 for establishing the epiblast/ES cell state, and Brn2 for the neural primordia. Thus, the regulation of SOX2 (and SOX1/3) and its partner factors, exemplified by Pax6, determines the spatio-temporal order of the occurrence of cell differentiation.},

	abstract = {Background
The Sox gene family of transcriptional regulators have essential roles during development and have been extensively studied in vertebrates. The mouse, human and fugu genomes contain at least 20 Sox genes, which are subdivided into groups based on sequence similarity of the highly conserved HMG domain. In the well-studied insect Drosophila melanogaster, eight Sox genes have been identified and are involved in processes such as neurogenesis, dorsal-ventral patterning and segmentation.

Results
We examined the available genome sequences of Apis mellifera, Nasonia vitripennis, Tribolium castaneum, Anopheles gambiae and identified Sox family members which were classified by phylogenetics using the HMG domains. Using in situ hybridisation we determined the expression patterns of eight honeybee Sox genes in honeybee embryo, adult brain and queen ovary. AmSoxB group genes were expressed in the nervous system, brain and Malphigian tubules. The restricted localization of AmSox21b and AmSoxB1 mRNAs within the oocyte, suggested a role in, or that they are regulated by, dorsal-ventral patterning. AmSoxC, D and F were expressed ubiquitously in late embryos and in the follicle cells of the queen ovary. Expression of AmSoxF and two AmSoxE genes was detected in the drone testis.

Conclusion
Insect genomes contain between eight and nine Sox genes, with at least four members belonging to Sox group B and other Sox subgroups each being represented by a single Sox gene. Hymenopteran insects have an additional SoxE gene, which may have arisen by gene duplication. Expression analyses of honeybee SoxB genes implies that this group of genes may be able to rapidly evolve new functions and expression domains, while the combined expression pattern of all the SoxB genes is maintained.},

	abstract = {Background
Group B Sox proteins are a highly conserved group of transcription factors that act extensively to coordinate nervous system development in higher metazoans while showing both co-expression and functional redundancy across a broad group of taxa. In Drosophila melanogaster, the two group B Sox proteins Dichaete and SoxNeuro show widespread common binding across the genome. While some instances of functional compensation have been observed in Drosophila, the function of common binding and the extent of its evolutionary conservation is not known.

Results
We used DamID-seq to examine the genome-wide binding patterns of Dichaete and SoxNeuro in four species of Drosophila. Through a quantitative comparison of Dichaete binding, we evaluated the rate of binding site turnover across the genome as well as at specific functional sites. We also examined the presence of Sox motifs within binding intervals and the correlation between sequence conservation and binding conservation. To determine whether common binding between Dichaete and SoxNeuro is conserved, we performed a detailed analysis of the binding patterns of both factors in two species.

Conclusion
We find that, while the regulatory networks driven by Dichaete and SoxNeuro are largely conserved across the drosophilids studied, binding site turnover is widespread and correlated with phylogenetic distance. Nonetheless, binding is preferentially conserved at known cis-regulatory modules and core, independently verified binding sites. We observed the strongest binding conservation at sites that are commonly bound by Dichaete and SoxNeuro, suggesting that these sites are functionally important. Our analysis provides insights into the evolution of group B Sox function, highlighting the specific conservation of shared binding sites and suggesting alternative sources of neofunctionalisation between paralogous family members.

Whereas most stress-signaling pathways are conserved between progenitors and differentiated cells, stem cells have the specific ability to respond by increasing their proliferative rate, using largely unknown mechanisms. Here, we show that a member of the Sox family of transcription factors in Drosophila, Sox21a, is expressed in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in the adult gut. Sox21a is essential for the proliferation of these cells during both normal epithelium turnover and repair. Its expression is induced in response to tissue damage, downstream of the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, to promote ISC proliferation. Although short-lived, Sox21a mutant flies show no developmental defects, supporting the notion that this factor is a specific regulator of adult stem cell proliferation.},

Using the Drosophila midgut model, we analyze at the cellular and molecular levels the differentiation program required for robust regeneration. We observe that the intestinal stem cell (ISC) and its differentiating daughter, the enteroblast (EB), form extended cell-cell contacts in regenerating intestines. The contact between progenitors is stabilized by cell adhesion molecules, and can be dynamically remodeled to elicit optimal juxtacrine Notch signaling to determine the speed of progenitor differentiation. Notably, increasing the adhesion property of progenitors by expressing Connectin is sufficient to induce rapid progenitor differentiation. We further demonstrate that JAK/STAT signaling, Sox21a and GATAe form a functional relay to orchestrate EB differentiation. Thus, our study provides new insights into the complex and sequential events that are required for rapid differentiation following stem cell division during tissue replenishment.},

Many signaling pathway components, including ligands of most major pathways, exhibit stem/progenitor-specific expression and have regulatory regions bound by both intrinsic and extrinsic transcription factors. In addition to previously identified stem/progenitor-derived ligands, we show that both the insulin-like factor Ilp6 and TNF ligand eiger are specifically expressed in the stem/progenitors and regulate normal tissue homeostasis.

Here we identified a novel feedback mechanism in controlling intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis in Drosophila. Sox21a, a group B Sox protein, is preferentially expressed in the committed progenitor named enteroblast (EB) to promote enterocyte differentiation. In Sox21a mutants, EBs do not divide, but cannot differentiate properly and have increased expression of mitogens, which then act as paracrine signals to promote intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation. This leads to a feedback amplification loop for rapid production of differentiation-defective EBs and tumorigenesis. Notably, in normal intestine following damage, Sox21a is temporally downregulated in EBs to allow the activation of the ISC-EB amplification loop for epithelial repair. We propose that executing a feedback amplification loop between stem cells and their progeny could be a common mechanism underlying tissue regeneration and tumorigenesis.},

Here we report that loss of the SOX transcription factor, Sox21a, blocks the differentiation programme of enteroblast (EB), the intestinal stem cell progeny in the adult Drosophila midgut. This results in EB accumulation and formation of tumours. Sox21a tumour initiation and growth involve stem cell proliferation induced by the unpaired 2 mitogen released from accumulating EBs generating a feed-forward loop. EBs found in the tumours are heterogeneous and grow towards the intestinal lumen. Sox21a tumours modulate their environment by secreting matrix metalloproteinase and reactive oxygen species. Enterocytes surrounding the tumours are eliminated through delamination allowing tumour progression, a process requiring JNK activation.

These are essential decisions that every cell is constantly challenged to make in multi-cellular organisms to ensure proper development, adult maintenance, and adaptability. SRY-related high-mobility-group box (Sox) transcription factors have emerged in the animal kingdom to help cells effect such decisions. They are encoded by twenty genes in humans and mice. They share a highly conserved high-mobility-group box domain that was originally identified in SRY, the sex-determining gene on the Y chromosome, and that has derived from a canonical high-mobility-group domain characteristic of chromatin-associated proteins. The high-mobility-group box domain binds DNA in the minor groove and increases its DNA binding affinity and specificity by interacting with many types of transcription factors. It also bends DNA and may thereby confer on Sox proteins a unique and critical role in the assembly of transcriptional enhanceosomes. Sox proteins fall into eight groups. Most feature a transactivation or transrepression domain and thereby also act as typical transcription factors. Each gene has distinct expression pattern and molecular properties, often redundant with those in the same group and overlapping with those in other groups. As a whole the Sox family controls cell fate and differentiation in a multitude of processes, such as male differentiation, stemness, neurogenesis, and skeletogenesis. We review their specific molecular properties and in vivo roles, stress recent advances in the field, and suggest directions for future investigations.},

We demonstrate that Pax6 initiates lens development by forming a molecular complex with SOX2 on the lens-specific enhancer elements, e.g., the δ-crystallin minimal enhancer DC5. DC5 shows a limited similarity to the binding consensus sequence of Pax6 and is bound poorly by Pax6 alone. However, Pax6 binds cooperatively with SOX2 to the DC5 sequence, resulting in formation of a high-mobility form of ternary complex in vitro, which correlates with the enhancer activation in vivo. We observed Pax6 and SOX2-interdependent factor occupancy of DC5 in a chromatin environment in vivo, providing the molecular basis of synergistic activation by Pax6 and SOX2. Subtle alterations of the Pax6-binding-site sequence of DC5 or of the inter-binding-sites distance diminished the cooperative binding and caused formation of a non-functional low-mobility form complex, suggesting DNA sequence-guided and protein interaction-induced conformation change of the Pax6 protein. When ectopically expressed in embryo ectoderm, Pax6 and SOX2 in combination activate δ-crystallin gene and elicit lens placode development, indicating that the complex of Pax6 and SOX2 formed on specific DNA sequences is the genetic switch for initiation of lens differentiation.},

The HMG-box transcription factors Sox1, Sox2 and Sox3 (Sox1–3) have previously been shown to suppress neurogenesis by maintaining neural cells in an undifferentiated state. Here we report that another HMG-box protein, Sox21, has the opposite activity and promotes neuronal differentiation. Using genetic studies in the chick embryo, we found that Sox21 mediates this function by counteracting the activity of Sox1–3. Accordingly, the balance of Sox21 and Sox1–3 activities determines whether neural cells remain as progenitors or commit to differentiation. Proneural basic helix-loop-helix proteins are essential for the establishment of neuronal fates. We now show that proneural proteins promote neurogenesis by upregulating Sox21 expression. These data establish a key role for Sox21 in the progression of neuronal differentiation and indicate that an important role of proneural proteins is their capacity to upregulate the expression of Sox21.},

One additional SOX sequence was retrieved from EST sequences of the cnidarian species Clytia hemisphaerica. Unexpected SOX gene diversity was found in these species, especially in the cnidarian and the ctenophore. The topology of gene relationships deduced by Maximum Likelihood analysis, although not supported by bootstrap values, suggested that the SOX family started to diversify in the metazoan stem branch prior to the divergence of demosponges, and that further diversification occurred in the eumetazoan branch, as well as later in calcisponges, ctenophores, cnidarians and vertebrates. In contrast, gene loss appears to have occurred in the nematode and probably in other protostome lineages, explaining their lower number of SOX genes.},

	abstract = {The success of Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism is largely due to the power of forward genetic screens to identify the genes that are involved in a biological process. Although traditional genetic screens, such as zygotic lethal screens, have been useful for identifying the genes that act early in fly development, more sophisticated and versatile screens have been developed. Modifier screens, in which genes are identified by their ability to alter the phenotype of flies that are genetically sensitized for the process of interest, are useful for finding the components of signal-transduction pathways. Clonal screens, in which cells that are homozygous for a mutation of interest can be made in an otherwise heterozygous animal through targeted mitotic recombination (using the Flp/FRT system), allow researchers to identify genes that act in a specific tissue at any stage of development. A modification of this technique, in which clones are made in the germ line, helps to find genes that are maternally supplied to the embryo. Mutant screens do not always identify all of the genes for which loss-of-function mutations give the phenotype of interest, as with genes that have redundant functions. In these cases, the GAL4–UAS system can be used to screen for mis- or overexpression phenotypes. The success of a genetic screen depends in large part on its design. As mapping and identifying genes that result from a screen can be very laborious, it is often preferable to sacrifice speed and the number of genes recovered in favour of a phenotype that is directly related to the process of interest. Genetic screens will continue to be useful in years to come, even once all genes have been identified. The functional characterization of genes relies on having allelic variants of each gene, which, for the time being, only genetic screens can provide.},

Marsupials also have a Y-borne SRY gene, implying that this mechanism is ancestral to therians, the SRY gene having diverged from its X-borne homologue SOX3 at least 180 million years ago. The rare exceptions have clearly lost and replaced the SRY mechanism recently. Other vertebrate classes have a variety of sex-determining mechanisms, but none shares the therian SRY-driven XX female:XY male system. In monotreme mammals (platypus and echidna), which branched from the therian lineage 210 million years ago, no orthologue of SRY has been found. In this study we show that its partner SOX3 is autosomal in platypus and echidna, mapping among human X chromosome orthologues to platypus chromosome 6, and to the homologous chromosome 16 in echidna. The autosomal localization of SOX3 in monotreme mammals, as well as non-mammal vertebrates, implies that SRY is absent in Prototheria and evolved later in the therian lineage 210-180 million years ago. Sex determination in platypus and echidna must therefore depend on another male-determining gene(s) on the Y chromosomes, or on the different dosage of a gene(s) on the X chromosomes.},

	abstract = {Background
Maleness in mammals is genetically determined by the Y chromosome. On the Y chromosome SRY is known as the mammalian male-determining gene. Both placental mammals (Eutheria) and marsupial mammals (Metatheria) have SRY genes. However, only eutherian SRY genes have been empirically examined by functional analyses, and the involvement of marsupial SRY in male gonad development remains speculative.

Results
In order to demonstrate that the marsupial SRY gene is similar to the eutherian SRY gene in function, we first examined the sequence differences between marsupial and eutherian SRY genes. Then, using a parsimony method, we identify 7 marsupial-specific ancestral substitutions, 13 eutherian-specific ancestral substitutions, and 4 substitutions that occurred at the stem lineage of therian SRY genes. A literature search and molecular dynamics computational simulations support that the lineage-specific ancestral substitutions might be involved with the functional differentiation between marsupial and eutherian SRY genes. To address the function of the marsupial SRY gene in male determination, we performed luciferase assays on the testis enhancer of Sox9 core (TESCO) using the marsupial SRY. The functional assay shows that marsupial SRY gene can weakly up-regulate the luciferase expression via TESCO.

Conclusions
Despite the sequence differences between the marsupial and eutherian SRY genes, our functional assay indicates that the marsupial SRY gene regulates SOX9 as a transcription factor in a similar way to the eutherian SRY gene. Our results suggest that SRY genes obtained the function of male determination in the common ancestor of Theria (placental mammals and marsupials). This suggests that the marsupial SRY gene has a function in male determination, but additional experiments are needed to be conclusive.

The HMG-box transcription factors Sox1, Sox2 and Sox3 (Sox1–3) have previously been shown to suppress neurogenesis by maintaining neural cells in an undifferentiated state. Here we report that another HMG-box protein, Sox21, has the opposite activity and promotes neuronal differentiation. Using genetic studies in the chick embryo, we found that Sox21 mediates this function by counteracting the activity of Sox1–3. Accordingly, the balance of Sox21 and Sox1–3 activities determines whether neural cells remain as progenitors or commit to differentiation. Proneural basic helix-loop-helix proteins are essential for the establishment of neuronal fates. We now show that proneural proteins promote neurogenesis by upregulating Sox21 expression. These data establish a key role for Sox21 in the progression of neuronal differentiation and indicate that an important role of proneural proteins is their capacity to upregulate the expression of Sox21.},

	abstract = {In addition to protein coding sequence, the human genome contains a significant amount of regulatory DNA, the identification of which is proving somewhat recalcitrant to both in silico and functional methods. An approach that has been used with some success is comparative sequence analysis, whereby equivalent genomic regions from different organisms are compared in order to identify both similarities and differences. In general, similarities in sequence between highly divergent organisms imply functional constraint. We have used a whole-genome comparison between humans and the pufferfish, Fugu rubripes, to identify nearly 1,400 highly conserved non-coding sequences. Given the evolutionary divergence between these species, it is likely that these sequences are found in, and furthermore are essential to, all vertebrates. Most, and possibly all, of these sequences are located in and around genes that act as developmental regulators. Some of these sequences are over 90\% identical across more than 500 bases, being more highly conserved than coding sequence between these two species. Despite this, we cannot find any similar sequences in invertebrate genomes. In order to begin to functionally test this set of sequences, we have used a rapid in vivo assay system using zebrafish embryos that allows tissue-specific enhancer activity to be identified. Functional data is presented for highly conserved non-coding sequences associated with four unrelated developmental regulators (SOX21, PAX6, HLXB9, and SHH), in order to demonstrate the suitability of this screen to a wide range of genes and expression patterns. Of 25 sequence elements tested around these four genes, 23 show significant enhancer activity in one or more tissues. We have identified a set of non-coding sequences that are highly conserved throughout vertebrates. They are found in clusters across the human genome, principally around genes that are implicated in the regulation of development, including many transcription factors. These highly conserved non-coding sequences are likely to form part of the genomic circuitry that uniquely defines vertebrate development.},

In many species, the Sox2 transcription factor is a marker of the nervous system from the beginning of its development, and we have previously shown that Sox2 is expressed in embryonic neural stem cells. It is also expressed in, and is essential for, totipotent inner cell mass stem cells and other multipotent cell lineages, and its ablation causes early embryonic lethality. To investigate the role of Sox2 in the nervous system, we generated different mouse mutant alleles: a null allele (Sox2beta-geo `knock-in'), and a regulatory mutant allele (Sox2ΔENH), in which a neural cell-specific enhancer is deleted. Sox2 is expressed in embryonic early neural precursors of the ventricular zone and, in the adult, in ependyma (a descendant of the ventricular zone). It is also expressed in the vast majority of dividing precursors in the neurogenic regions, and in a small proportion of differentiated neurones, particularly in the thalamus, striatum and septum. Compound Sox2beta-geo/ΔENH heterozygotes show important cerebral malformations, with parenchymal loss and ventricle enlargement, and L-dopa-rescuable circling behaviour and epilepsy. We observed striking abnormalities in neurones; degeneration and cytoplasmic protein aggregates, a feature common to diverse human neurodegenerative diseases, are observed in thalamus, striatum and septum. Furthermore, ependymal cells show ciliary loss and pathological lipid inclusions. Finally, precursor cell proliferation and the generation of new neurones in adult neurogenic regions are greatly decreased, and GFAP/nestin-positive hippocampal cells, which include the earliest neurogenic precursors, are strikingly diminished. These findings highlight a crucial and unexpected role for Sox2 in the maintenance of neurones in selected brain areas, and suggest a contribution of neural cell proliferative defects to the pathological phenotype.},

The 30-bp sequence of the enhancer including these sites (Nes30) showed a nervous system-specific and SOX-POU-dependent enhancer activity in multimeric forms in transfection assays and was utilized in assessing the specificity of the synergism; combinations of either group B1 or group C SOX (SOX11) with class III POU proved effective. In embryonic day 13.5 mouse spinal cord, Nestin was expressed in the cells with nuclei in the ventricular and subventricular zones. SOX1/2/3 expression was confined to the nuclei of the ventricular zone; SOX11 localized to the nuclei of both subventricular (high-level expression) and intermediate (low-level expression) zones. Class III POU (Brn2) was expressed at high levels, localizing to the nucleus in the ventricular and subventricular zones; moderate expression was observed in the intermediate zone, distributed in the cytoplasm. These data support the model that synergic interactions between group B1/C SOX and class III POU within the nucleus determine Nestin expression.

SOX2 is a prominent pioneer factor that is essential for pluripotency and self-renewal of embryonic stem cells3. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the DNA-binding domains of SOX2 and its close homologue SOX11 bound to nucleosomes. The structures show that SOX factors can bind and locally distort DNA at superhelical location 2. The factors also facilitate detachment of terminal nucleosomal DNA from the histone octamer, which increases DNA accessibility. SOX-factor binding to the nucleosome can also lead to a repositioning of the N-terminal tail of histone H4 that includes residue lysine 16. We speculate that this repositioning is incompatible with higher-order nucleosome stacking, which involves contacts of the H4 tail with a neighbouring nucleosome. Our results indicate that pioneer transcription factors can use binding energy to initiate chromatin opening, and thereby facilitate nucleosome remodelling and subsequent transcription.},

	abstract = {Background: Neurogenesis requires neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation, neuronal migration, and differentiation. During embryonic development, neurons are generated in specific areas of the developing neuroepithelium and migrate to their appropriate positions. In the adult brain, neurogenesis continues in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle. Although neurogenesis is fundamental to brain development and function, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate neurogenesis is still limited. Results: In this study, we generated a Sox11 floxed allele and a Sox11 null allele in mice using the Cre-loxP technology. We first analyzed the role of the transcription factor Sox11 in embryonic neurogenesis using Sox11 null embryos. We also examined the role of Sox11 in adult hippocampal neurogenesis using Sox11 conditional knockout mice in which Sox11 is specifically deleted in adult NPCs. Sox11 null embryos developed small and disorganized brains, accompanied by transient proliferation deficits in NPCs. Deletion of Sox11 in adult NPCs blunted proliferation in the SGZ. Using functional genomics, we identified potential downstream target genes of Sox11. Conclusions: Taken together, our work provides evidence that Sox11 is required for both embryonic and adult neurogenesis, and identifies potential downstream target genes.

Here we show that, in the adult mouse hippocampus, expression of the SoxC transcription factors Sox4 and Sox11 is initiated around the time of neuronal commitment of adult NSCs and is maintained in immature neurons. Overexpression of Sox4 and Sox11 strongly promotes in vitro neurogenesis from adult NSCs, whereas ablation of Sox4/Sox11 prevents in vitro and in vivo neurogenesis from adult NSCs. Moreover, we demonstrate that SoxC transcription factors target the promoters of genes that are induced on neuronal differentiation of adult NSCs. Finally, we show that reprogramming of astroglia into neurons is dependent on the presence of SoxC factors. These data identify SoxC proteins as essential contributors to the genetic network controlling neuronal differentiation in adult neurogenesis and neuronal reprogramming of somatic cells.},

Such induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells were generated from mouse fibroblasts by retroviral transduction of four transcription factors: Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc. Mouse iPS cells are indistinguishable from embryonic stem (ES) cells in many respects and produce germline-competent chimeras. Reactivation of the c-Myc retrovirus, however, increases tumorigenicity in the chimeras and progeny mice, hindering clinical applications. Here we describe a modified protocol for the generation of iPS cells that does not require the Myc retrovirus. With this protocol, we obtained significantly fewer non-iPS background cells, and the iPS cells generated were consistently of high quality. Mice derived from Myc(-) iPS cells did not develop tumors during the study period. The protocol also enabled efficient isolation of iPS cells without drug selection. Furthermore, we generated human iPS cells from adult dermal fibroblasts without MYC.},

However, most applications to date have relied on aberrant DNA repair to stochastically generate frameshifting indels and adoption has been limited by a lack of tools for efficient identification of targeted events. Here we report optimized tools and techniques for expanded application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in Drosophila through homology-directed repair (HDR) with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) donor templates that facilitate complex genome engineering through the precise incorporation of large DNA sequences, including screenable markers. Using these donors, we demonstrate the replacement of a gene with exogenous sequences and the generation of a conditional allele. To optimize efficiency and specificity, we generated transgenic flies that express Cas9 in the germline and directly compared HDR and off-target cleavage rates of different approaches for delivering CRISPR components. We also investigated HDR efficiency in a mutant background previously demonstrated to bias DNA repair toward HDR. Finally, we developed a web-based tool that identifies CRISPR target sites and evaluates their potential for off-target cleavage using empirically rooted rules. Overall, we have found that injection of a dsDNA donor and guide RNA-encoding plasmids into vasa-Cas9 flies yields the highest efficiency HDR and that target sites can be selected to avoid off-target mutations. Efficient and specific CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR opens the door to a broad array of complex genome modifications and greatly expands the utility of CRISPR technology for Drosophila research.},

It has also been incorporated into numerous publicly available software packages and web services. During this period, we have greatly expanded Primer3’s functionality. In this article, we describe Primer3’s current capabilities, emphasizing recent improvements. The most notable enhancements incorporate more accurate thermodynamic models in the primer design process, both to improve melting temperature prediction and to reduce the likelihood that primers will form hairpins or dimers. Additional enhancements include more precise control of primer placement—a change motivated partly by opportunities to use whole-genome sequences to improve primer specificity. We also added features to increase ease of use, including the ability to save and re-use parameter settings and the ability to require that individual primers not be used in more than one primer pair. We have made the core code more modular and provided cleaner programming interfaces to further ease integration with other software. These improvements position Primer3 for continued use with genome-scale data in the decade ahead.},

The analysis is focused on the annealing of primers at alternative binding sites (competitive annealing) and the main result is a quantitative expression of the efficiency (η) of annealing as a function of temperature (TA), annealing period tA) and template composition. The optimal efficiency lies in a narrow region of TA and tA for GC-rich templates and a much broader region for normal GC templates. To confirm the theoretical findings, the following genes have been PCR amplified from human cDNA template: ARX, and HBB (with 78.72\% and 52.99\% GC respectively). Theoretical results are in excellent agreement with the experimental findings. Optimum annealing times for GC-rich genes lie in the range of 3 to 6 seconds and depend on annealing temperature. Annealing times greater than 10 seconds yield smeared PCR amplified products. The non-GC-rich gene did not exhibit this sensitivity to annealing times. Theory and experimental results show that, shorter annealing times are not only sufficient but also necessary for efficient PCR amplification of GC-rich templates.},

All major classes were further subdivided into multiple subtypes, revealing biological features of various cell-types. We further assessed transcriptional changes in response to starvation at the single-cell level. While after starvation the composition of the brain remains unaffected, transcriptional profile of several cell clusters changed. Intriguingly, different cell-types show very distinct responses to starvation, suggesting the presence of cell-specific programs for nutrition availability.

	abstract = {We introduce a new algorithm for modularity-based community detection in large networks. The algorithm, which we refer to as a smart local moving algorithm, takes advantage of a well-known local moving heuristic that is also used by other algorithms. Compared with these other algorithms, our proposed algorithm uses the local moving heuristic in a more sophisticated way. Based on an analysis of a diverse set of networks, we show that our smart local moving algorithm identifies community structures with higher modularity values than other algorithms for large-scale modularity optimization, among which the popular “Louvain algorithm”. The computational efficiency of our algorithm makes it possible to perform community detection in networks with tens of millions of nodes and hundreds of millions of edges. Our smart local moving algorithm also performs well in small and medium-sized networks. In short computing times, it identifies community structures with modularity values equally high as, or almost as high as, the highest values reported in the literature, and sometimes even higher than the highest values found in the literature.},

Its goal is to achieve a comprehensive and objective global network, including direct (physical) as well as indirect (functional) interactions. The latest version of STRING (11.0) more than doubles the number of organisms it covers, to 5090. The most important new feature is an option to upload entire, genome-wide datasets as input, allowing users to visualize subsets as interaction networks and to perform gene-set enrichment analysis on the entire input. For the enrichment analysis, STRING implements well-known classification systems such as Gene Ontology and KEGG, but also offers additional, new classification systems based on high-throughput text-mining as well as on a hierarchical clustering of the association network itself.

Further study of single cell profiles across different conditions enables the understanding of biological processes and underlying mechanisms at the sub-population level. However, developing proper methodology to compare multiple scRNA-Seq datasets remains challenging.
RESULTS: We have developed ClusterMap, a systematic method and workflow to facilitate the comparison of scRNA-seq profiles across distinct biological contexts. Using hierarchical clustering of the marker genes of each sub-group, ClusterMap matches the sub-types of cells across different samples and provides 'similarity' as a metric to quantify the quality of the match. We introduce a purity tree cut method designed specifically for this matching problem. We use Circos plot and regrouping method to visualize the results concisely. Furthermore, we propose a new metric 'separability' to summarize sub-population changes among all sample pairs. In the case studies, we demonstrate that ClusterMap has the ability to provide us further insight into the different molecular mechanisms of cellular sub-populations across different conditions.

	abstract = {The molecular mechanisms underlying pluripotency and lineage specification from embryonic stem (ES) cells are largely unclear. Differentiation pathways may be determined by the targeted activation of lineage specific genes or by selective silencing of genome regions during differentiation. Here we show that the ES cell genome is transcriptionally globally hyperactive and undergoes global silencing as cells differentiate. Normally silent repeat regions are active in ES cells and tissue-specific genes are sporadically expressed at low levels. Whole genome tiling arrays demonstrate widespread transcription in both coding and non-coding regions in pluripotent ES cells whereas the transcriptional landscape becomes more discrete as differentiation proceeds. The transcriptional hyperactivity in ES cells is accompanied by disproportionate expression of chromatin-remodeling genes and the general transcription machinery, but not histone modifying activities. Interference with several chromatin remodeling activities in ES cells affects their proliferation and differentiation behavior. We propose that global transcriptional activity is a hallmark of pluripotent ES cells that contributes to their plasticity and that lineage specification is strongly driven by reduction of the actively transcribed portion of the genome.},

	abstract = {Neural progenitors undergo temporal patterning to generate diverse neurons in a chronological order. This process is well-studied in the developing Drosophila brain and conserved in mammals. During larval stages, intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) serially express Dichaete (D), grainyhead (Grh) and eyeless (Ey/Pax6), but how the transitions are regulated is not precisely understood. Here, we developed a method to isolate transcriptomes of INPs in their distinct temporal states to identify a complete set of temporal patterning factors. Our analysis identifies odd-paired (opa), as a key regulator of temporal patterning. Temporal patterning is initiated when the SWI/SNF complex component Osa induces D and its repressor Opa at the same time but with distinct kinetics. Then, high Opa levels repress D to allow Grh transcription and progress to the next temporal state. We propose that Osa and its target genes opa and D form an incoherent feedforward loop (FFL) and a new mechanism allowing the successive expression of temporal identities., The brain consists of billions of neurons that come in a range of shapes and sizes, with different types of neurons specialized to perform different tasks. Despite their diversity, all of these neurons originate from a single population known as neural stem cells. As the brain develops, each neural stem cell divides to produce two daughter cells: one remains a stem cell, which can then divide again, and the other becomes a neuron., A longstanding question in developmental biology is how a limited pool of neural stem cells can generate so many different types of neurons. The answer seems to lie in a process known as temporal identity, whereby neural stem cells of different ages give rise to different types of neurons. This requires neural stem cells to keep track of their own age, but it is still unclear how they can do so., Abdusselamoglu et al. have now uncovered part of the underlying mechanism behind temporal identity by studying fruit flies, an insect in which the early stages of brain development are similar to the ones in mammals. A method was developed to sort fly neural stem cells into groups based on their age. Comparing these groups revealed that a protein called Opa make neural stem cells switch from being 'young' to being 'middle-aged'. Another protein, Osa activates Opa, which in turn represses a protein called Dichaete. As Dichaete is mainly active in young neural stem cells, the actions of Osa and Opa push neural stem cells into middle age., Fruit flies are therefore a valuable system with which to study the mechanisms that regulate neural stem cell aging. Revealing how the brain generates different types of neurons could help us study the way these cells organize themselves into complex circuits. This knowledge could then be harnessed to understand how these processes go wrong and disrupt development.},

	abstract = {Background
The Enhancer of split complex is an unusual gene complex found in Arthropod genomes. Where known this complex of genes is often regulated by Notch cell signalling and is critically important for neurogenesis. The Enhancer of split complex is made up of two different classes of genes, basic helix-loop-helix-orange domain transcription factors and bearded class genes. The association of these genes has been detected in the genomes of insects and crustaceans.

Results
Tracing the evolution of the Enhancer of split complex in recently sequenced Arthropod genomes indicates that enhancer of split basic helix-loop-helix orange domain genes arose before the common ancestor of insects and Crustacea, and before the formation of the complex. Throughout insect and crustacean evolution, a four-gene cluster has been present with lineage specific gene losses and duplications. The complex can be found in the vast majority of genomes, but appears to be missing from the genomes of chalcid wasps, raising questions as to how they carry out neurogenesis in the absence of these crucial genes.

Conclusions
The enhancer of split complex arose in the common ancestor of Crustacea and insects, probably through the linkage of a basic helix-loop-helix orange domain gene and a bearded class gene. The complex has been maintained, with variations, throughout insect and crustacean evolution indicating some function of the complex, such as coordinate regulation, may maintain its structure through evolutionary time.

In Drosophila, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Neuralized (Neur) promotes the endocytosis and signaling activity of the ligand Delta (Dl). In this study, we identify proteins of the Bearded (Brd) family as interactors of Neur. We show that Tom, a prototypic Brd family member, inhibits Neur-dependent Notch signaling. Overexpression of Tom inhibits the endocytosis of Dl and interferes with the interaction of Dl with Neur. Deletion of the Brd gene complex results in ectopic endocytosis of Dl in dorsal cells of stage 5 embryos. This defect in Dl trafficking is associated with ectopic expression of the single-minded gene, a direct Notch target gene that specifies the mesectoderm. We propose that inhibition of Neur by Brd proteins is important for precise spatial regulation of Dl signaling.},

	abstract = {The brain consists of various types of neurons that are generated from neural stem cells; however, the mechanisms underlying neuronal diversity remain uncertain. A recent study demonstrated that the medulla, the largest component of the Drosophila optic lobe, is a suitable model system for brain development because it shares structural features with the mammalian brain and consists of a moderate number and various types of neurons. The concentric zones in the medulla primordium that are characterized by the expression of four transcription factors, including Homothorax (Hth), Brain-specific homeobox (Bsh), Runt (Run) and Drifter (Drf), correspond to types of medulla neurons. Here, we examine the mechanisms that temporally determine the neuronal types in the medulla primordium. For this purpose, we searched for transcription factors that are transiently expressed in a subset of medulla neuroblasts (NBs, neuronal stem cell-like neural precursor cells) and identified five candidates (Hth, Klumpfuss (Klu), Eyeless (Ey), Sloppy paired (Slp) and Dichaete (D)). The results of genetic experiments at least explain the temporal transition of the transcription factor expression in NBs in the order of Ey, Slp and D. Our results also suggest that expression of Hth, Klu and Ey in NBs trigger the production of Hth/Bsh-, Run- and Drf-positive neurons, respectively. These results suggest that medulla neuron types are specified in a birth order-dependent manner by the action of temporal transcription factors that are sequentially expressed in NBs.},

Moreover, recent studies reveal involvement of key epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes in NB selection, but the regulatory interplay between Notch signaling and the EMT machinery is unclear. We find that SoxNeuro (SoxB family) and worniu (Snail family) are integrated with the Notch pathway, and constitute the missing proneural genes. Notch signaling, the proneural, SoxNeuro, and worniu genes regulate key EMT genes to orchestrate the NB selection process. Hence, we uncover an expanded lateral inhibition network for NB selection and demonstrate its link to key players in the EMT machinery. The evolutionary conservation of the genes involved suggests that the Notch-SoxB-Snail-EMT network may control neural progenitor selection in many other systems.},

	abstract = {A great challenge in development biology is to understand how interacting networks of regulatory genes can direct the often highly complex patterning of cells in a 3D embryo. Here, we detail the gene regulatory network that describes the distribution of ciliary band-associated neurons in the bipinnaria larva of the sea star. This larva, typically for the ancestral deuterostome dipleurula larval type that it represents, forms two loops of ciliary bands that extend across much of the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral ectoderm. We show that the sea star first likely uses maternally inherited factors and the Wnt and Delta pathways to distinguish neurogenic ectoderm from endomesoderm. The broad neurogenic potential of the ectoderm persists throughout much of gastrulation. Nodal, bone morphogenetic protein 2/4 (Bmp2/4), and Six3-dependent pathways then sculpt a complex ciliary band territory that is defined by the expression of the forkhead transcription factor, foxg. Foxg is needed to define two molecularly distinct ectodermal domains, and for the formation of differentiated neurons along the edge of these two territories. Thus, significantly, Bmp2/4 signaling in sea stars does not distinguish differentiated neurons from nonneuronal ectoderm as it does in many other animals, but instead contributes to the patterning of an ectodermal territory, which then, in turn, provides cues to permit the final steps of neuronal differentiation. The modularity between specification and patterning likely reflects the evolutionary history of this gene regulatory network, in which an ancient module for specification of a broad neurogenic potential ectoderm was subsequently overlaid with a module for patterning.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neural development requires that neurons communicate and co-operate with one another and with other cell types in their environment. Drosophila Armadillo and its vertebrate homolog beta-catenin have dual roles in epithelial cells: transducing signals from the Wingless/Wnt family of proteins and working with cadherins to mediate cell adhesion. Wingless/Wnt signaling also directs certain cell fates in the central nervous system (CNS), and cadherins and catenins are thought to function together during neural development.
RESULTS: We identified and analyzed the biochemical properties of a second armadillo isoform, with a truncated carboxyl terminus generated by alternative splicing. This isoform was found to accumulate in differentiating neurons. Using armadillo alleles that selectively inactivate the cell adhesion or the Wingless signaling functions of Armadillo, we found that Armadillo had two sequential roles in neural development. Armadillo function in Wingless signal transduction was required early in development for determination of neuroblast fate. Later in development, disruption of the cell-cell adhesion function of Armadillo resulted in subtle defects in the construction of the axonal scaffold. Mutations in the gene encoding the Drosophila tyrosine kinase Abelson substantially enhanced the severity of the CNS phenotype of armadillo mutations, consistent with these proteins functioning co-operatively at adherens junctions in both the CNS and the epidermis.
CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first demonstrations of a role for the cadherin-catenin system in the normal development of the CNS. The genetic interactions between armadillo and abelson point to a possible role for the tyrosine kinase Abelson in cell-cell adhesive junctions in both the CNS and the epidermis.},

	abstract = {Experimental results obtained from research using only one sex are sometimes extrapolated to both sexes without thorough justification. However, this might cause enormous economic loss and unintended fatalities. Between years 1997 and 2000, the US Food and Drug Administration suspended ten prescription drugs producing severe adverse effects on the market. Eight of the ten drugs caused greater health risks in women. Serious male biases in basic, preclinical, and clinical research were the main reason for the problem. This mini-review will describe why and how funding organizations such as the European Commission, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and the US National Institutes of Health have tried to influence researchers to integrate sex/gender not only in clinical research, but also in basic and preclinical research. Editorial policies of prominent journals for sex-specific reporting will also be introduced, and some considerations in integrating sex as a biological variable will be pointed out. To produce precise and reproducible results applicable for both men and women, sex should be considered as an important biological variable from basic and preclinical research.},

	abstract = {The SOX family of transcription factors have emerged as modulators of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in diverse development and disease contexts. There are over twenty SOX proteins encoded in the vertebrate genome and recent evidence suggests that many of these can physically interact with beta-catenin and modulate the transcription of Wnt-target genes. The precise mechanisms by which SOX proteins regulate beta-catenin/TCF activity are still being resolved and there is evidence to support a number of models including; protein-protein interactions, the binding of SOX factors to Wnt-target gene promoters, the recruitment of co-repressors or co-activators, modulation of protein stability and nuclear translocation. In some contexts Wnt signaling also regulates SOX expression resulting in feedback regulatory loops that fine tune cellular responses to beta-catenin/TCF activity. In this review we summarize the examples of Sox-Wnt interactions and examine the underlying mechanisms of this potentially wide spread and underappreciated mode of Wnt-regulation.},

The Aspergillus nidulans mating type gene matA and the human SRY (Sex-Determining Region Y) encode proteins containing a single HMG (high-mobility group) domain. Analysis of the amino-acid sequence of MatA and SRY transcription factors revealed significant structural similarity. The human SRY protein is able to functionally replace MatA and drives the sexual cycle in the fungus A. nidulans. Functional studies indicate that SRY drives early fruiting body development, and hybrid MatA protein carrying the SRY HMG box is fully capable of driving both early and late stages of sexual development, including gametogenesis. Our data suggest that SRY and MatA are both structurally and functionally related and conserved in regulating sexual processes. The fundamental mechanisms driving evolution of the genetic pathways underlying sex determination, sex chromosomes and sexual reproduction in eukaryotes appear similar.},

	abstract = {Members of the SOX family of transcription factors are found throughout the animal kingdom, are characterized by the presence of a DNA-binding HMG domain, and are involved in a diverse range of developmental processes. Previous attempts to group SOX genes and deduce their structural, functional, and evolutionary relationships have relied largely on complete or partial HMG box sequence of a limited number of genes. In this study, we have used complete HMG domain sequence, full-length protein structure, and gene organization data to study the pattern of evolution within the family. For the first time, a substantial number of invertebrate SOX sequences have been included in the analysis. We find support for subdivision of the family into groups A-H, as has been suggested in some previous studies, and for the assignment of two new groups, I and J. For vertebrate genes, it appears that relatedness as suggested by HMG domain sequence is congruent with relatedness as indicated by overall structure of the full-length protein and intron-exon structure of the genes. Most of the SOX groups identified in vertebrates were represented by a single SOX sequence in each invertebrate species studied. We have named anonymous sequences and, where appropriate, have suggested systematic names for some previously identified sequences. In addition, we identify an HMG domain signature motif which may be considered representative of the SOX family. Based on our data, we propose a robust phylogeny of SOX genes that reflects their evolutionary history in metazoans.},

Like HMG1, SRY binds to kinked DNA structures, and bends linear DNA sharply upon binding. We analysed the biochemical properties of mutant SRY proteins from five patients with complete gonadal dysgenesis: two bind and bend DNA almost normally, two bind inefficiently but bend DNA normally, and one binds DNA with almost normal affinity but produces a different angle. The mutations with moderate effect on complex formation can be transmitted to progeny, the ones with severe effects on either binding or bending are de novo. The angle induced by SRY depends on the exact DNA sequence, thus discriminating different target sites. We suggest that the exact spatial arrangement of the nucleoprotein complex organized by SRY in chromatin is essential for the expression of genes involved in testis differentiation.},

They share at least 50\% homology in their HMG domains, which bind the DNA element AACAAT. How different SOX proteins achieve specific regulation of target genes is not known. We determined the DNA-binding specificity of SOX9 using a random oligonucleotide selection assay. The optimal SOX9 binding sequence, AGAACAATGG, contained a core DNA-binding element AACAAT, flanked by 5' AG and 3' GG nucleotides. The specific interaction between SOX9 and AGAACAATGG was confirmed by mobility shift assays, DNA competition and dissociation studies. The 5' AG and 3' GG flanking nucleotides enhance binding by SOX9 HMG domain, but not by the HMG domain of another SOX factor, SRY. For SRY, different 5' and 3' flanking nucleotides are preferred. Our studies support the notion that SOX proteins achieve DNA sequence specificity through subtle preferences for flanking nucleotides and that this is likely to be dictated by signature amino acids in their HMG domains. Furthermore, the related HMG domains of SOX9 and Sox17 have similar optimal binding sites that differ from those of SRY and Sox5, suggesting that SOX factors may co-evolve with their DNA targets to achieve specificity.},

Less evolutionarily derived insects undergo short germ segmentation where only the anterior segments are specified before gastrulation whereas the remaining posterior segments are formed during a later secondary growth phase. In contrast, derived long germ insects such as Drosophila specify their entire bodies essentially simultaneously. These fundamental embryological differences imply potentially divergent molecular patterning events. Numerous studies have focused on comparing the expression and function of the homologs of Drosophila segmentation genes between Drosophila and different short and long germ insects. Here we review these comparative data with special emphasis on understanding how short germ insects generate segments and how this ancestral mechanism may have been modified in derived long germ insects such as Drosophila. We break down the larger issue of short versus long germ segmentation into its component developmental problems and structure our discussion in order to highlight the unanswered questions in the evolution of insect segmentation.},

	abstract = {SOX2 is a master regulator of both pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and multipotent neural progenitor cells (NPCs); however, we currently lack a detailed understanding of how SOX2 controls these distinct stem cell populations. Here we show by genome-wide analysis that, while SOX2 bound to a distinct set of gene promoters in ESCs and NPCs, the majority of regions coincided with unique distal enhancer elements, important cis-acting regulators of tissue-specific gene expression programs. Notably, SOX2 bound the same consensus DNA motif in both cell types, suggesting that additional factors contribute to target specificity. We found that, similar to its association with OCT4 (Pou5f1) in ESCs, the related POU family member BRN2 (Pou3f2) co-occupied a large set of putative distal enhancers with SOX2 in NPCs. Forced expression of BRN2 in ESCs led to functional recruitment of SOX2 to a subset of NPC-specific targets and to precocious differentiation toward a neural-like state. Further analysis of the bound sequences revealed differences in the distances of SOX and POU peaks in the two cell types and identified motifs for additional transcription factors. Together, these data suggest that SOX2 controls a larger network of genes than previously anticipated through binding of distal enhancers and that transitions in POU partner factors may control tissue-specific transcriptional programs. Our findings have important implications for understanding lineage specification and somatic cell reprogramming, where SOX2, OCT4, and BRN2 have been shown to be key factors.},

We used hepatocytes from an aneuploid mouse strain carrying human chromosome 21 to determine, on a chromosomal scale, whether interspecies differences in transcriptional regulation are primarily directed by human genetic sequence or mouse nuclear environment. Virtually all transcription factor–binding locations, landmarks of transcription initiation, and the resulting gene expression observed in human hepatocytes were recapitulated across the entire human chromosome 21 in the mouse hepatocyte nucleus. Thus, in homologous tissues, genetic sequence is largely responsible for directing transcriptional programs; interspecies differences in epigenetic machinery, cellular environment, and transcription factors themselves play secondary roles.
An aneuploid mouse carrying a human chromosome shows that genetic sequence can dominate epigenetic, cellular, and organismal effects in determining transcriptional regulation and gene expression.

We compared activity-dependent transcriptional responses in developing human stem cell-derived cortical neurons with those induced in developing primary- or stem cell-derived mouse cortical neurons. While activity-dependent gene-responsiveness showed little dependence on developmental stage or origin (primary tissue vs. stem cell), notable species-dependent differences were observed. Moreover, differential species-specific gene ortholog regulation was recapitulated in aneuploid mouse neurons carrying human chromosome-21, implicating promoter/enhancer sequence divergence as a factor, including human-specific activity-responsive AP-1 sites.

However, the probability of committing false statistical inferences would considerably increase when more than one hypothesis is simultaneously tested (namely the multiple comparisons), which therefore requires proper adjustment. Although the adjustment for multiple comparisons is proposed to be mandatory in some journals, it still remains difficult to select a proper method suitable for the various experimental properties and study purposes, especially for researchers without good background in statistics. In the present paper, we provide a brief review on mathematical framework, general concepts and common methods of adjustment for multiple comparisons, which is expected to facilitate the understanding and selection of adjustment methods.},

	abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

Drosophila neural stem cells segregate cell-fate determinants from the self-renewing cell to the differentiating daughter at each division. Here, we show that one such determinant, the homeodomain transcription factor Prospero, regulates the choice between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. We have identified the in vivo targets of Prospero throughout the entire genome. We show that Prospero represses genes required for self-renewal, such as stem cell fate genes and cell-cycle genes. Surprisingly, Prospero is also required to activate genes for terminal differentiation. We further show that in the absence of Prospero, differentiating daughters revert to a stem cell-like fate: they express markers of self-renewal, exhibit increased proliferation, and fail to differentiate. These results define a blueprint for the transition from stem cell self-renewal to terminal differentiation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Site-specific transcription factors (TFs) bind DNA regulatory elements to control expression of target genes, forming the core of gene regulatory networks. Despite decades of research, most studies focus on only a small number of TFs and the roles of many remain unknown.
RESULTS: We present a systematic characterization of spatiotemporal gene expression patterns for all known or predicted Drosophila TFs throughout embryogenesis, the first such comprehensive study for any metazoan animal. We generated RNA expression patterns for all 708 TFs by in situ hybridization, annotated the patterns using an anatomical controlled vocabulary, and analyzed TF expression in the context of organ system development. Nearly all TFs are expressed during embryogenesis and more than half are specifically expressed in the central nervous system. Compared to other genes, TFs are enriched early in the development of most organ systems, and throughout the development of the nervous system. Of the 535 TFs with spatially restricted expression, 79\% are dynamically expressed in multiple organ systems while 21\% show single-organ specificity. Of those expressed in multiple organ systems, 77 TFs are restricted to a single organ system either early or late in development. Expression patterns for 354 TFs are characterized for the first time in this study.
CONCLUSIONS: We produced a reference TF dataset for the investigation of gene regulatory networks in embryogenesis, and gained insight into the expression dynamics of the full complement of TFs controlling the development of each organ system.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cell and tissue specific gene expression is a defining feature of embryonic development in multi-cellular organisms. However, the range of gene expression patterns, the extent of the correlation of expression with function, and the classes of genes whose spatial expression are tightly regulated have been unclear due to the lack of an unbiased, genome-wide survey of gene expression patterns.
RESULTS: We determined and documented embryonic expression patterns for 6,003 (44\%) of the 13,659 protein-coding genes identified in the Drosophila melanogaster genome with over 70,000 images and controlled vocabulary annotations. Individual expression patterns are extraordinarily diverse, but by supplementing qualitative in situ hybridization data with quantitative microarray time-course data using a hybrid clustering strategy, we identify groups of genes with similar expression. Of 4,496 genes with detectable expression in the embryo, 2,549 (57\%) fall into 10 clusters representing broad expression patterns. The remaining 1,947 (43\%) genes fall into 29 clusters representing restricted expression, 20\% patterned as early as blastoderm, with the majority restricted to differentiated cell types, such as epithelia, nervous system, or muscle. We investigate the relationship between expression clusters and known molecular and cellular-physiological functions.
CONCLUSION: Nearly 60\% of the genes with detectable expression exhibit broad patterns reflecting quantitative rather than qualitative differences between tissues. The other 40\% show tissue-restricted expression; the expression patterns of over 1,500 of these genes are documented here for the first time. Within each of these categories, we identified clusters of genes associated with particular cellular and developmental functions.},

RESULTS: As a first step to creating a comprehensive atlas of gene-expression patterns during Drosophila embryogenesis, we examined 2,179 genes by in situ hybridization to fixed Drosophila embryos. Of the genes assayed, 63.7\% displayed dynamic expression patterns that were documented with 25,690 digital photomicrographs of individual embryos. The photomicrographs were annotated using controlled vocabularies for anatomical structures that are organized into a developmental hierarchy. We also generated a detailed time course of gene expression during embryogenesis using microarrays to provide an independent corroboration of the in situ hybridization results. All image, annotation and microarray data are stored in publicly available database. We found that the RNA transcripts of about 1\% of genes show clear subcellular localization. Nearly all the annotated expression patterns are distinct. We present an approach for organizing the data by hierarchical clustering of annotation terms that allows us to group tissues that express similar sets of genes as well as genes displaying similar expression patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: Analyzing gene-expression patterns by in situ hybridization to whole-mount embryos provides an extremely rich dataset that can be used to identify genes involved in developmental processes that have been missed by traditional genetic analysis. Systematic analysis of rigorously annotated patterns of gene expression will complement and extend the types of analyses carried out using expression microarrays.},

The remarkable diversity of neurons in the nervous system is generated during development, when properties such as cell morphology, receptor profiles and neurotransmitter identities are specified. In order to gain a greater understanding of neurotransmitter specification we profiled the transcription state of cholinergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in vivo at three developmental time points. We identified 86 differentially expressed transcription factors that are uniquely enriched, or uniquely depleted, in a specific neurotransmitter type. Some transcription factors show a similar profile across development, others only show enrichment or depletion at specific developmental stages. Profiling of Acj6 (cholinergic enriched) and Ets65A (cholinergic depleted) binding sites in vivo reveals that they both directly bind the ChAT locus, in addition to a wide spectrum of other key neuronal differentiation genes. We also show that cholinergic enriched transcription factors are expressed in mostly non-overlapping populations in the adult brain, implying the absence of combinatorial regulation of neurotransmitter fate in this context. Furthermore, our data underlines that, similar to Caenorhabditis elegans, there are no simple transcription factor codes for neurotransmitter type specification.

	abstract = {The cerebellum, which forms from anterior hindbrain, coordinates motor movements and balance. Sensory input from the periphery is relayed and modulated by cerebellar interneurons, which are organized in layers. The mechanisms that specify the different neurons of the cerebellum and direct its layered organization remain poorly understood. Drawing from investigations of spinal cord, we hypothesized that the embryonic cerebellum is patterned on the dorsoventral axis by opposing morphogens. We tested this using zebrafish. Here we show that expression of olig2, which encodes a bHLH transcription factor, marks a distinct subset of neurons with similarities to eurydendroid neurons, the principal efferent neurons of the teleost cerebellum. In combination with other markers, olig2 reveals a dorsoventral organization of cerebellar neurons in embryos. Disruption of Hedgehog signaling, which patterns the ventral neural tube, produced a two-fold increase in the number of olig2+ neurons. By contrast, olig2+ neurons did not develop in embryos deficient for Wnt signaling, which patterns dorsal neural tube, nor did they develop in embryos deficient for both Hedgehog and Wnt signaling. Our data indicate that Hedgehog and Wnt work in opposition across the dorsoventral axis of the cerebellum to regulate formation of olig2+ neurons. Specifically, we propose that Hedgehog limits the range of Wnt signaling, which is necessary for olig2+ neuron development.},

Recent findings indicate that morphogen gradients also serve to guide axonal pathfinding during development of the nervous system. These findings challenge our previous notions about morphogens and axon guidance molecules and suggest that these proteins, rather than having sharply divergent functions, act more globally to provide graded positional information that can be interpreted by responding cells either to specify cell fate or to direct axonal pathfinding. This chapter presents the roles identified for members of three prominent morphogen families—the Hedgehog, Wnt and TGF-beta/BMP families—in axon guidance, and discusses potential implications for the molecular mechanisms underlying their guidance functions.},

Here, we used the global run-on sequencing assay (GRO-seq) to map the genome-wide RNA polymerase distribution during early Drosophila embryogenesis, thus providing insights into how genes are regulated. We identify widespread promoter-proximal pausing yet show that the presence of paused polymerase does not necessarily equate to direct regulation through pause release to productive elongation. Our data reveal that a subset of early Zelda-activated genes is regulated at the level of polymerase recruitment, whereas other Zelda target and axis patterning genes are predominantly regulated through pause release. In contrast to other signaling pathways, we found that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) target genes are collectively more highly paused than BMP pathway components and show that BMP target gene expression requires the pause-inducing negative elongation factor (NELF) complex. Our data also suggest that polymerase pausing allows plasticity in gene activation throughout embryogenesis, as transiently repressed and transcriptionally silenced genes maintain and lose promoter polymerases, respectively. Finally, we provide evidence that the major effect of pausing is on the levels, rather than timing, of transcription. These data are discussed in terms of the efficiency of transcriptional activation required across cell populations during developmental time constraints.},

This novel procedure uses the template-switching activity of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase to synthesize and anchor first-strand cDNA in one step. Following reverse transcription, three cycles of PCR are performed using a modified oligo(dT) primer and an anchor primer to enrich the cDNA population for full-length sequences. Starting with 1 microgram human skeletal muscle poly(A)+ RNA, a cDNA library was constructed that contained 3 x 10(6) independent clones with an average insert size of 2 kb. Sequence analysis of 172 randomly selected clones showed that 77\% of cDNA clones corresponding to known genes contained intact open reading frames. The average length of complete open reading frames was 2.4 kb. Furthermore, 86\% of the full-length clones retained longer 5' UTR sequences than the longest 5' end deposited in the GenBank database. cDNA libraries generated using this method will be useful for accelerating the collection of mRNA 5' end sequence information, which is currently very limited in GenBank.},

Here we describe a novel strategy to access such complex samples. Single-cell RNA-seq expression profiles were generated, and clustered to form a two-dimensional cell map onto which expression data were projected. The resulting cell map integrates three levels of organization: the whole population of cells, the functionally distinct subpopulations it contains, and the single cells themselves-all without need for known markers to classify cell types. The feasibility of the strategy was demonstrated by analyzing the transcriptomes of 85 single cells of two distinct types. We believe this strategy will enable the unbiased discovery and analysis of naturally occurring cell types during development, adult physiology, and disease.},

Differential distribution of transcripts between sister cells is seen as early as the two-cell stage embryo, and zygotic expression in the somatic cell lineages is enriched for transcription factors.

Additionally, transcript subcellular localization is directly visualized, enabling the analysis of transcription (initiation and elongation), RNA export and degradation. As part of our efforts to investigate how this type of analysis can generate improved models of gene expression, we used smFISH to quantify the kinetic expression of STL1 and CTT1 mRNAs in single Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells upon 0.2 and 0.4 M NaCl osmotic stress.

Here, axons of olfactory receptor neurons synapse with dendrites of the projection neurons that relay olfactory input to higher brain centers, such as the mushroom bodies and lateral horn. Interactions between olfactory receptor neurons and projection neurons are modulated by excitatory and inhibitory input from a group of local interneurons. While significant insight has been gleaned into the differentiation of olfactory receptor and projection neurons, much less is known about the development and function of the local interneurons. We have found that Dichaete, a conserved Sox HMG box gene, is strongly expressed in a cluster of LAAL cells located adjacent to each antennal lobe in the adult brain. Within these clusters, Dichaete protein expression is detected in both cholinergic and GABAergic local interneurons. In contrast, Dichaete expression is not detected in mature or developing projection neurons, or developing olfactory receptor neurons. Analysis of novel viable Dichaete mutant alleles revealed misrouting of specific projection neuron dendrites and axons, and alterations in glomeruli organization. These results suggest non-cell autonomous functions of Dichaete in projection neuron differentiation as well as a potential role for Dichaete-expressing local interneurons in development of the adult olfactory circuitry.},

In the Drosophila visual system, T4/T5 neurons represent the first stage of computation of the direction of visual motion. T4 and T5 neurons exist in four subtypes, each responding to motion in one of the four cardinal directions and projecting axons into one of the four lobula plate layers. However, all T4/T5 neurons share properties essential for sensing motion. How T4/T5 neurons acquire their properties during development is poorly understood. We reveal that the transcription factors SoxN and Sox102F control the acquisition of properties common to all T4/T5 neuron subtypes, i.e. the layer specificity of dendrites and axons. Accordingly, adult flies are motion blind after disruption of SoxN or Sox102F in maturing T4/T5 neurons. We further find that the transcription factors Ato and Dac are redundantly required in T4/T5 neuron progenitors for SoxN and Sox102F expression in T4/T5 neurons, linking the transcriptional programmes specifying progenitor identity to those regulating the acquisition of morphological properties in neurons. Our work will help to link structure, function and development in a neuronal type performing a computation that is conserved across vertebrate and invertebrate visual systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract Embryonic stem cell (ESC) identity is orchestrated by co-operativity between the transcription factors (TFs) Sox2 and the class V POU-TF Oct4 at composite Sox/Oct motifs. Neural stem cells (NSCs) lack Oct4 but express Sox2 and class III POU-TFs Oct6, Brn1 and Brn2. This raises the question of how Sox2 interacts with POU-TFs to transcriptionally specify ESCs versus NSCs. Here, we show that Oct4 alone binds the Sox/Oct motif and the octamer-containing palindromic MORE equally well. Sox2 binding selectively increases the affinity of Oct4 for the Sox/Oct motif. In contrast, Oct6 binds preferentially to MORE and is unaffected by Sox2. ChIP-Seq in NSCs shows the MORE to be the most enriched motif for class III POU-TFs, including MORE subtypes, and that the Sox/Oct motif is not enriched. These results suggest that in NSCs, co-operativity between Sox2 and class III POU-TFs may not occur and that POU-TF-driven transcription uses predominantly the MORE cis architecture. Thus, distinct interactions between Sox2 and POU-TF subclasses distinguish pluripotent ESCs from multipotent NSCs, providing molecular insight into how Oct4 alone can convert NSCs to pluripotency.},

To address this, we present a modeling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq experiments. We propose that the Pearson residuals from “regularized negative binomial regression,” where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression. Our approach can be applied to any UMI-based scRNA-seq dataset and is freely available as part of the R package sctransform, with a direct interface to our single-cell toolkit Seurat.},

	abstract = {Advances in single-cell technologies have enabled high-resolution dissection of tissue composition. Several tools for dimensionality reduction are available to analyze the large number of parameters generated in single-cell studies. Recently, a nonlinear dimensionality-reduction technique, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), was developed for the analysis of any type of high-dimensional data. Here we apply it to biological data, using three well-characterized mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Comparing the performance of UMAP with five other tools, we find that UMAP provides the fastest run times, highest reproducibility and the most meaningful organization of cell clusters. The work highlights the use of UMAP for improved visualization and interpretation of single-cell data.},
